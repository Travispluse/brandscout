## Two Fundamentally Different Approaches

Every brand name falls somewhere on a spectrum. On one end: descriptive names that tell you exactly what the company does (General Electric, British Airways). On the other: abstract names that mean nothing until the brand gives them meaning (Apple, Nike, Uber).

Both strategies can build billion-dollar brands. The right choice depends on your market, budget, and ambitions.

## Descriptive Names Explained

Descriptive names communicate the product or service directly. Examples: Whole Foods, General Motors, Pizza Hut, The Home Depot, Bank of America.

### Advantages
- **Instant clarity.** No marketing needed to explain what you do.
- **SEO benefits.** Descriptive names often contain keywords customers search for.
- **Trust building.** In unfamiliar categories, descriptive names reduce perceived risk.
- **Lower marketing costs.** You don't need to "teach" people what the name means.

### Disadvantages
- **Hard to trademark.** Descriptive names receive weak trademark protection because they use common words in their ordinary meaning.
- **Limited flexibility.** "Pizza Hut" can't easily expand into tacos. "Amazon" can sell anything.
- **Forgettable.** Descriptive names blend together — can you tell FastShip from QuickShip from SpeedShip?
- **Competitive crowding.** In mature markets, every descriptive variation is taken.

## Abstract Names Explained

Abstract names have no inherent connection to the product. Examples: Apple, Nike, Amazon, Uber, Virgin, Patagonia.

### Advantages
- **Strong trademarks.** Abstract names receive the strongest legal protection because they're arbitrary or fanciful.
- **Maximum flexibility.** The name doesn't limit what you can sell or where you can expand.
- **Memorability.** Distinctive names stand out in crowded markets.
- **Global scalability.** Abstract names avoid translation issues better than descriptive ones.

### Disadvantages
- **Requires marketing investment.** You need to build the association between name and product through advertising and experience.
- **Initial confusion.** If someone hears "Stripe" for the first time, they don't know it's a payments company.
- **Harder to launch.** The name does zero heavy lifting in the early days when nobody knows you.

## The Spectrum Between

Most successful brand names aren't purely abstract or purely descriptive. They live on a spectrum:

1. **Generic:** "Computer Store" (no trademark protection, no distinctiveness)
2. **Descriptive:** "General Electric" (tells you the category)
3. **Suggestive:** "Salesforce" (hints at what you do without stating it)
4. **Arbitrary:** "Apple" (real word, unrelated to product)
5. **Fanciful:** "Google" (invented word)

**Suggestive names** often hit the sweet spot — they hint at the brand's value without being too literal. Think Slack (suggests ease), Shopify (suggests shopping), or Headspace (suggests mental clarity).

## Decision Framework

### Choose Descriptive When:
- You're in a brand-new category people don't understand yet
- You have a limited marketing budget
- Your target market values clarity over creativity
- SEO for industry keywords is critical to your growth strategy
- You operate locally and need instant recognition

### Choose Abstract When:
- You plan to expand into multiple products or markets
- Trademark protection is important (competitive or litigious industry)
- You have the budget to build brand awareness
- You're in a crowded market where descriptive names all sound the same
- You want to build a lifestyle or platform brand

### Choose Suggestive When:
- You want the best of both worlds
- Your product benefits can be hinted at metaphorically
- You want trademark strength without the marketing investment of pure abstraction

## How to Make Either Strategy Work

### Making Descriptive Names Distinctive
- Add an unexpected modifier: "Honest Tea" (not just "Organic Tea")
- Use wordplay: "Grubhub" (descriptive + memorable)
- Create a compound: "Mailchimp" (two descriptive words create something unique)

### Making Abstract Names Clear
- Pair with a descriptive tagline: Stripe — "Payments infrastructure for the internet"
- Use visual branding to create associations
- Invest in content marketing that builds the connection

## Check Availability for Both Approaches

Descriptive names face tougher availability challenges — common words are often already claimed. Abstract names are usually more available but still need verification.

Whatever approach you choose, verify your name with [BrandScout](/) to check domains, social handles, and trademarks before you invest in branding.
