# Aftermarket Domain Buying Guide: How to Purchase Already-Registered Domains

You've found the perfect brand name, but the domain is already taken. Don't panic — the aftermarket domain market is a thriving ecosystem where millions of domains change hands every year. Here's how to navigate it successfully.

## What Is the Domain Aftermarket?

The domain aftermarket refers to the secondary market where previously registered domains are bought and sold. Unlike registering a fresh domain for $10-15, aftermarket domains can range from a few hundred dollars to millions, depending on factors like length, keywords, and extension.

Major aftermarket platforms include Afternic, Sedo, GoDaddy Auctions, and Dan.com. Each has its own fee structure and buyer protections.

## How to Find Domains for Sale

### Check "For Sale" Landing Pages

Many domain investors park their domains with "This domain is for sale" pages. Visit the URL directly to see if there's a listed price or a contact form.

### Use Aftermarket Marketplaces

Search platforms like Sedo, Afternic, or Dan.com to find listed domains. These marketplaces aggregate millions of domains and often provide instant buy-it-now pricing.

### WHOIS Lookup and Direct Contact

If a domain isn't listed anywhere, run a WHOIS lookup to find the registrant's contact information. Send a professional, concise email expressing interest. Avoid revealing how badly you want the domain — this weakens your negotiating position.

## Negotiation Strategies

### Start Low but Reasonable

Opening with an insultingly low offer wastes everyone's time. Research comparable sales using tools like NameBio to understand market value, then offer 30-50% below your maximum budget.

### Don't Reveal Your Identity

If you're a well-funded startup, use a broker or generic email. Sellers adjust prices based on perceived buyer wealth.

### Be Patient

Domain negotiations often take weeks or months. Sellers may not respond immediately. Follow up politely after 7-10 days, but don't pressure.

### Set a Walk-Away Price

Decide your maximum budget before negotiations begin and stick to it. There's always another domain that could work for your brand.

## Using an Escrow Service

Never send payment directly to a seller. Always use an escrow service like Escrow.com, which holds funds until the domain transfer is complete. Here's the process:

1. Buyer and seller agree on price
2. Buyer deposits funds into escrow
3. Seller transfers the domain to the buyer's registrar
4. Buyer verifies receipt
5. Escrow releases funds to the seller

Most marketplaces like Dan.com have built-in escrow, simplifying the process.

## Red Flags to Watch For

- **Seller wants direct payment** via PayPal, crypto, or wire without escrow
- **Domain has trademark issues** — check the USPTO database before buying
- **Domain has a spammy history** — use the Wayback Machine and Google to check for past spam or penalties
- **Seller can't verify ownership** — insist on proof before proceeding
- **Price seems too good to be true** — it probably is

## Understanding Domain Pricing

Several factors affect aftermarket domain prices:

- **Length**: Shorter domains (3-5 characters) command premium prices
- **Keywords**: Domains with high-value keywords (insurance, crypto, etc.) cost more
- **Extension**: .com domains are significantly more expensive than alternatives
- **Brandability**: Easy-to-pronounce, memorable names carry a premium
- **Search volume**: Domains matching popular search terms are more valuable

## Before You Buy: Check Everything First

Before committing to an aftermarket purchase, verify that your brand name works across all the channels you need — not just the domain. Check social media handles, app store availability, and trademark databases.

Try [BrandScout](/) to instantly check your desired brand name across domains and social platforms. It's free and takes seconds — and it might save you from spending thousands on a domain for a name that's already taken everywhere else.

## Final Tips

- Always get a signed purchase agreement for high-value domains
- Transfer the domain to your own registrar immediately after purchase
- Update WHOIS information and enable privacy protection
- Set up auto-renewal so you never accidentally lose your new domain

The aftermarket can be intimidating, but with research, patience, and proper escrow protection, you can secure the perfect domain for your brand.
