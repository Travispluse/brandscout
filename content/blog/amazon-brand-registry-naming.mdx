## What Is Amazon Brand Registry?

Amazon Brand Registry gives brand owners control over their product listings. It unlocks A+ content, brand analytics, and protection against counterfeiters. But to enroll, you need a registered trademark — and that starts with choosing the right name.

## The Trademark Requirement

Amazon requires either a registered trademark or a pending trademark application to join Brand Registry. This means your brand name must be:

- **Unique enough to trademark** — Generic or descriptive names get rejected
- **Not already trademarked** by someone else in your product category
- **Consistent** across your trademark filing and your Amazon listings

The trademark must be a text-based mark or an image-based mark with words. Design-only marks without text don't qualify.

## Choosing a Name That Clears Trademark

### Avoid Descriptive Names

"Premium Leather Wallets" describes a product — it's not a brand. The USPTO will reject it. Instead, invent a name that suggests quality without being literal: "Vortic Leather" or "HideCraft."

### Check the USPTO Database

Before you invest in a name, search the Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) at USPTO.gov. Look for identical and similar marks in your product class. A trademark attorney can help with a comprehensive search, but a preliminary check saves time.

### Think Internationally

If you sell globally on Amazon, consider trademark conflicts in the EU, UK, Canada, and other markets. A name that's clear in the US might be trademarked elsewhere.

## Amazon-Specific Naming Considerations

### Brand Name vs. Product Name

Your brand name appears at the top of every listing. Product names sit in the title. Keep them distinct. "Vortic Leather" is the brand. "The Meridian Wallet" is the product. This structure scales as you add products.

### Avoid Amazon Policy Violations

Amazon prohibits brand names that:

- Include "Amazon," "Prime," or related terms
- Are misleading about the product's origin
- Contain special characters that break the catalog system

### Plan for Brand Store URLs

Enrolled brands get an Amazon Store (amazon.com/yourbrand). Pick a name that creates a clean URL. Short names with common spellings work best.

## The Registration Process

1. **Choose your brand name** and verify it's unique
2. **File a trademark application** with the USPTO (or your country's office)
3. **Wait for assignment of a serial number** — you can apply to Brand Registry with a pending application via Amazon's IP Accelerator
4. **Enroll in Brand Registry** at brandregistry.amazon.com
5. **Verify** through a code sent to the trademark correspondent

The process takes 8-12 months for full trademark registration, but IP Accelerator can speed up Brand Registry access.

## Protecting Your Brand After Registration

Once enrolled, use Amazon's tools:

- **Report violations** when other sellers misuse your name
- **Use Transparency codes** for product authentication
- **Monitor with Brand Dashboard** for potential infringements

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Registering a generic name** that won't hold up legally
- **Choosing a name too similar to existing Amazon brands** — customers get confused, and Amazon may flag conflicts
- **Skipping the domain registration** — claim yourname.com even if you only sell on Amazon
- **Not checking social media** — you'll need these channels for brand building
