## Why Analytics From Day One

Every visitor to your new website tells a story: where they came from, what they looked at, and whether they took action. Without analytics, you're guessing. With analytics, you're making informed decisions about content, marketing, and product development.

## Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Setup

GA4 is the current version of Google Analytics. It's free and the industry standard for website analytics.

### Step 1: Create a Google Analytics Account

1. Go to analytics.google.com
2. Click "Start measuring"
3. Enter your account name (your brand name)
4. Configure data sharing settings
5. Click Next

### Step 2: Create a Property

1. Enter your property name (your website name)
2. Set your time zone and currency
3. Answer the business questions
4. Accept the terms of service

### Step 3: Set Up a Data Stream

1. Select "Web" as your platform
2. Enter your website URL
3. Name your stream
4. Click "Create stream"

### Step 4: Install the Tracking Code

GA4 gives you a Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX). Install it on your site:

**Website builders:**
- **Squarespace:** Settings → Advanced → External API Keys → Google Analytics ID
- **WordPress:** Use a plugin like Site Kit by Google or manually add to your theme
- **Shopify:** Online Store → Preferences → Google Analytics
- **Webflow:** Project Settings → Integrations → Google Analytics

**Manual installation:** Add the Google tag (gtag.js) snippet to every page's head section.

### Step 5: Verify Installation

1. Visit your website in a new browser tab
2. In GA4, go to Reports → Realtime
3. You should see yourself as an active user

## Essential GA4 Configuration

### Set Up Conversions

Conversions track the actions that matter most to your business:

- Form submissions
- Product purchases
- Newsletter signups
- Phone calls
- Button clicks

In GA4, mark key events as conversions in Admin → Events.

### Configure Enhanced Measurement

GA4 automatically tracks:
- Page views
- Scrolls
- Outbound clicks
- Site search
- Video engagement
- File downloads

Enable all of these in Admin → Data Streams → Enhanced Measurement.

### Exclude Internal Traffic

Filter out your own visits to keep data clean:

1. Go to Admin → Data Streams → your stream
2. Configure Tag Settings → Define internal traffic
3. Add your IP address
4. Create a data filter to exclude internal traffic

### Link Google Search Console

Connect GSC to GA4 for combined search and behavior data:

1. Go to Admin → Product Links → Search Console Links
2. Select your Search Console property
3. Link them together

## Other Analytics Tools to Consider

### Google Tag Manager (GTM)

**What it does:** Manages all your tracking codes in one place — GA4, Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn, etc.

**Why use it:** Adding and updating tracking codes without editing your website's code. Essential once you're running multiple marketing channels.

### Microsoft Clarity

**Cost:** Free
**What it does:** Session recordings and heatmaps showing how visitors interact with your pages.

**Why use it:** See exactly where people click, how far they scroll, and where they get confused. Invaluable for improving your website.

### Plausible or Fathom

**Cost:** Starting at $9/month
**What they do:** Privacy-focused analytics alternatives to Google Analytics.

**Why use them:** If you prefer not to send data to Google, these tools provide essential metrics without cookies.

## Key Metrics for New Brands

Focus on these metrics initially:

### Traffic Metrics
- **Users:** How many unique visitors?
- **Sessions:** How many total visits?
- **Traffic sources:** Where do visitors come from?

### Engagement Metrics
- **Engagement rate:** Percentage of engaged sessions (replaced bounce rate)
- **Average engagement time:** How long do visitors actively interact?
- **Pages per session:** How deep do visitors explore?

### Conversion Metrics
- **Conversion rate:** What percentage of visitors take your desired action?
- **Conversion sources:** Which channels drive the most conversions?

## Building a Dashboard

Create a simple dashboard you check weekly:

1. **Traffic overview** — Users, sessions, new vs. returning
2. **Top traffic sources** — Organic, direct, social, referral
3. **Top pages** — Which content performs best?
4. **Conversions** — How many goal completions?
5. **Device breakdown** — Mobile vs. desktop

In GA4, use the "Library" section to customize your reports.

## Common Analytics Mistakes

- **Not filtering internal traffic** — Your own visits skew the data
- **Tracking everything but analyzing nothing** — Focus on actionable metrics
- **Making decisions on too little data** — Wait for statistical significance
- **Ignoring mobile** — Check mobile behavior separately
- **Not setting up conversions** — Traffic without goals is vanity metrics
