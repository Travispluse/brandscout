# How Domain Backordering Works: Catch Expiring Domains Before Anyone Else

That perfect domain is taken — but the owner might not renew it. Domain backordering lets you get in line to catch it the moment it drops. Here's how the system works and how to maximize your chances.

## What Is Domain Backordering?

A domain backorder is a request placed with a service to automatically attempt to register a domain as soon as it expires and becomes available. When a domain owner doesn't renew, the domain goes through a deletion cycle. Backorder services monitor this cycle and use automated systems to grab the domain the instant it's released.

## The Domain Expiration Lifecycle

Understanding the timeline is crucial:

1. **Expiration date** — The domain stops resolving (or shows a registrar parking page)
2. **Grace period (0-45 days)** — The original owner can still renew at normal price
3. **Redemption period (30 days)** — Owner can reclaim for a higher fee ($80-200+)
4. **Pending delete (5 days)** — Domain is queued for deletion
5. **Drop** — Domain becomes available for registration

The entire cycle from expiration to drop typically takes 60-80 days. Backorder services monitor step 5.

## Top Backorder Services

### SnapNames
One of the oldest and most reliable services. If multiple people backorder the same domain, it goes to a private auction among backorderers.

### NameJet
Similar to SnapNames with strong infrastructure for catching high-value drops. Known for premium domain inventory.

### GoDaddy Auctions
GoDaddy has a massive registrar advantage — they can catch domains expiring at GoDaddy before they hit the public drop pool. Their "Closeout" feature also offers expired domains at reduced prices.

### Dropcatch.com
A newer player with competitive catch rates. Uses a similar auction model for contested domains.

## How to Place a Backorder

1. **Identify your target domain** — Find domains with upcoming expiration dates
2. **Check the domain's status** — Verify it's actually expiring (some show as expired but are in grace period)
3. **Place backorders on multiple services** — Each service costs $10-80 per backorder. Using multiple services increases your chances since each has different infrastructure
4. **Wait** — If the domain drops, the service attempts to catch it
5. **If caught with no competition** — You get the domain at the backorder fee
6. **If caught with competition** — You enter an auction against other backorderers

## Strategies for Success

### Use Multiple Services

No single service has a 100% catch rate. Placing backorders across 2-3 services dramatically increases your odds, especially for desirable domains.

### Research Before Ordering

Check the domain's traffic, backlinks, and history. A domain that looks appealing might have been penalized by Google or used for spam.

### Monitor Expiration Dates

Use tools like ExpiredDomains.net, DomCop, or FreshDrop to track upcoming expirations and find valuable domains before other backordering customers do.

### Set a Budget for Auctions

Most desirable domains attract multiple backorders, triggering auctions. Decide your maximum bid in advance. Getting caught up in auction fever leads to overpaying.

### Check Registrar Lock Status

Some domains are locked by their registrars during the expiration process. Registrar-specific backorder services may have better access to these.

## What If the Domain Doesn't Drop?

Backorders only work if the owner genuinely fails to renew. If the owner renews during the grace or redemption period, your backorder is cancelled and typically refunded.

This happens more often than you'd think — roughly 70-80% of domains that enter the expiration cycle are eventually renewed.

## Costs and Fees

- **Backorder placement**: $10-80 per domain per service
- **Successful catch (no auction)**: Usually included in the backorder fee
- **Auction wins**: Market price — could be $100 or $100,000
- **Refund policy**: Most services refund if the domain isn't caught

## Check Availability First

Before backordering an expiring domain, make sure the brand name works across your entire digital presence. There's no point catching a domain if the matching social handles are all taken.

Use [BrandScout](/) to check your brand name across domains and social platforms instantly. If the name checks out everywhere, then it's worth placing that backorder.
