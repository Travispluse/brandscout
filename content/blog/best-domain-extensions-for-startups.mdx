## The TLD Landscape Has Changed

A decade ago, the answer was simple: get the .com. Today, startups have over 1,500 top-level domains to choose from. While .com remains dominant, alternatives like .io, .ai, .co, and .dev have gained real legitimacy.

Here's what actually works in 2026.

## Tier 1: The Gold Standard

### .com
Still the default. Still the most trusted. Users type .com instinctively, and email deliverability is highest with .com domains. If you can get a good .com, get it.

**Best for:** Every business. Universal trust and recognition.
**Downside:** Most good names are taken. Expect to pay premium prices or get creative with compound names.

## Tier 2: Strong Alternatives

### .io
Originally the country code for British Indian Ocean Territory, .io became the tech startup default. It signals "tech company" to a savvy audience.

**Best for:** Developer tools, SaaS, B2B tech.
**Downside:** Ongoing geopolitical concerns about the British Indian Ocean Territory could theoretically affect the TLD's future. Also, non-tech audiences may not recognize it.

### .ai
Exploded in popularity with the AI boom. It's the country code for Anguilla, but it's become synonymous with artificial intelligence companies.

**Best for:** AI/ML companies, data products, tech tools.
**Downside:** Expensive ($50-100/year for registration). May feel gimmicky if your product isn't actually AI-powered.

### .co
Short for "company" in practice (officially Colombia's country code). Used by major brands like Twitter (t.co) and Google (g.co).

**Best for:** Startups wanting a short, clean alternative to .com.
**Downside:** People might think you meant .com and mistype.

### .dev
Google-owned TLD for developers. Requires HTTPS, which is a security bonus.

**Best for:** Developer tools, personal developer portfolios, open-source projects.
**Downside:** Narrow audience perception.

## Tier 3: Niche but Viable

### .app
Another Google-owned TLD. Clean, modern, requires HTTPS.

**Best for:** Mobile apps, SaaS products.

### .design
Self-explanatory. Works well for design agencies and portfolio sites.

### .store / .shop
E-commerce focused TLDs that clearly signal online retail.

### .xyz
Cheap and increasingly popular. Used by Google's parent company Alphabet (abc.xyz).

**Best for:** Budget-conscious startups, experimental projects.

### .tech
Direct and clear. Signals technology focus.

## Tier 4: Generally Avoid

### .biz, .info, .net
These carry spam associations from the early 2000s. They don't signal quality.

### .ninja, .guru, .rocks
Fun but unprofessional. Fine for personal projects, risky for businesses.

### Random country codes (.tk, .ml, .ga)
Free domains from small nations. Heavily associated with spam and phishing.

## Decision Framework

Ask yourself:

1. **Is a reasonable .com available?** (Even with a modifier like "get," "try," or "use" prefix?) If yes, go .com.
2. **Is your audience technical?** .io and .dev are safe choices.
3. **Is AI core to your product?** .ai makes sense.
4. **Is your audience general consumers?** Stick with .com or .co.
5. **Are you bootstrapping on a tight budget?** .xyz or .co are affordable.

## The Multi-TLD Strategy

Smart startups secure multiple extensions:
- Primary: yourname.com (or .io/.ai)
- Defensive: yourname.co, yourname.net (redirect to primary)
- Country-specific: yourname.co.uk, yourname.de (for international expansion)

This prevents competitors and squatters from confusing your customers.

## Check All Extensions at Once

Don't check domain availability one extension at a time. Use [BrandScout](/) to see which extensions are available for your brand name across all major TLDs — plus social handles and trademarks — in a single search.
