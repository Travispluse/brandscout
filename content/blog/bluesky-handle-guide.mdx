# Bluesky Handle Guide: Everything You Need to Know About AT Protocol Handles

Bluesky has emerged as one of the most interesting social platforms of the 2020s, built on the AT Protocol with a unique approach to identity. Its handle system offers branding possibilities no other social network provides.

## How Bluesky Handles Work

Bluesky uses a two-tier handle system:

### Default Handles
When you sign up, you get a handle like @yourname.bsky.social. This works like a traditional username on any other platform.

### Custom Domain Handles
Bluesky's killer feature: you can use your own domain as your handle. Instead of @yourname.bsky.social, you become @yourdomain.com. This is unique among social platforms.

## Using Your Domain as Your Handle

### Why This Matters
Your domain becomes your verified identity. If your handle is @acme.com, everyone knows you're the real Acme because only the domain owner can set this up. No blue checkmarks needed — your domain IS your verification.

### How to Set It Up
1. Go to Settings → Change Handle in Bluesky
2. Select "I have my own domain"
3. Add the provided DNS TXT record to your domain
4. Bluesky verifies the record and updates your handle

### The Branding Power
Imagine your handle is @yourstartup.com. Every reply, repost, and post carries your domain — it's free advertising for your website. This is a branding opportunity no other platform offers.

## Choosing Your Bluesky Handle

### If You Have a Domain
Use it. @yourbrand.com is always better than @yourbrand.bsky.social. It's more professional, acts as verification, and promotes your website.

### If You Don't Have a Domain
Claim a clean .bsky.social handle that matches your brand name on other platforms. Keep it short and consistent.

### Subdomain Handles
You can use subdomains too: @team.yourbrand.com for team members. This creates a built-in organizational verification system.

## Bluesky for Brand Building

### Early Mover Advantage
Bluesky is still growing. Claiming your brand name now — when availability is high — is a smart defensive move.

### Community Focus
Bluesky's community values authenticity and substance. Brand accounts that share genuine insights and engage meaningfully perform well.

### Custom Feeds
Bluesky allows custom algorithmic feeds. Brands can create feeds relevant to their niche, becoming a discovery hub for their community.

### Decentralized Identity
Because Bluesky runs on the AT Protocol, your identity is portable. If you ever want to move to a different AT Protocol server, your content and followers can come with you.

## Bluesky vs Other Platforms

### vs X (Twitter)
Bluesky's AT Protocol means your data isn't locked to one company. Custom domain handles provide built-in verification. The community tends to be more technical and early-adopter oriented.

### vs Threads
Threads has Instagram's massive user base behind it. Bluesky has a more decentralized, tech-forward community. Different audiences, different strategies.

### vs Mastodon
Both are decentralized, but Bluesky is more accessible to mainstream users. Mastodon's instance system can be confusing; Bluesky feels more like traditional social media.

## Best Practices

- **Claim your handle early** — Even if you're not active yet
- **Use your domain** if you have one — It's the most powerful feature
- **Cross-reference** your Bluesky in your website bio and other social profiles
- **Be authentic** — Bluesky's community rewards genuine engagement
- **Post consistently** — The algorithm favors active accounts

## Secure Your Brand Across Platforms

Your Bluesky handle should be part of a consistent brand identity. Before choosing a name, verify it's available across all the platforms that matter.
