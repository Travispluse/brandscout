## What's the Difference?

Many founders use "brand name" and "brand identity" interchangeably. That's a mistake that leads to shallow branding decisions.

Your **brand name** is a single element — the word or phrase people use to refer to your business. Your **brand identity** is the entire system of visual, verbal, and emotional cues that shape how people perceive you.

Think of it this way: your brand name is your first handshake. Your brand identity is every conversation that follows.

## The Components of Brand Identity

Brand identity encompasses far more than a name:

- **Visual identity:** Logo, color palette, typography, imagery style
- **Verbal identity:** Tone of voice, messaging framework, tagline
- **Experiential identity:** Customer service style, packaging, user experience
- **Cultural identity:** Values, mission, internal culture that radiates outward

Your brand name sits at the center of all of this, but it cannot carry the weight alone.

## Why Your Brand Name Still Matters Enormously

Even though identity is broader, the name is where everything starts. A strong brand name:

- **Creates instant associations.** "Patagonia" evokes rugged nature before you see a single ad.
- **Enables word-of-mouth.** People can't recommend you if they can't remember or pronounce your name.
- **Anchors the identity system.** Every visual and verbal choice flows from and reinforces the name.

A weak name forces your identity to work harder. A strong name gives your identity a running start.

## How to Align Name and Identity

### Start With Strategy, Not Creativity

Before brainstorming names, define your brand positioning. Who are you for? What do you stand for? What makes you different? These answers constrain and guide both your name and your broader identity.

### Test Name Candidates Against Identity Goals

When evaluating potential names, ask:

- Does this name support the emotional tone we want? A playful brand shouldn't have a corporate-sounding name.
- Can this name flex across visual treatments? Some names look great in bold type but fall apart in script fonts.
- Does this name leave room for the identity to evolve? Overly descriptive names like "Quick Local Delivery" box you in.

### Build Identity Around the Name, Not the Other Way Around

Once you've chosen a name, let it inform your identity decisions. The sounds, rhythm, and connotations of the name should guide your color choices, typography, and voice. "Ember" suggests warm tones and bold fonts. "Whisper" suggests muted palettes and delicate type.

## Common Mistakes

**Designing a logo before finalizing the name.** You'll waste time and money redesigning when the name changes.

**Choosing a name that contradicts your identity goals.** If your identity is premium and minimal, a name like "BargainBuddy" undermines everything.

**Neglecting verbal identity.** Many brands invest heavily in visual identity but never define how they sound. Your brand voice should be as deliberate as your color palette.

## The Right Order of Operations

1. Define brand strategy (positioning, audience, values)
2. Develop and select the brand name
3. Build verbal identity (voice, messaging, tagline)
4. Build visual identity (logo, colors, typography)
5. Apply across all touchpoints

Skipping steps or doing them out of order creates misalignment that's expensive to fix later.

## Practical Exercise

Write down your brand name. Then write five adjectives you want people to associate with your brand. Now honestly assess: does the name naturally support those adjectives, or does it fight against them?

If there's tension, you have two choices — adjust the identity goals or reconsider the name. Doing neither guarantees a confused brand.

## Moving Forward

The best brands achieve seamless alignment between name and identity. Apple's name is simple, human, and unexpected for a tech company — which perfectly supports its identity as an approachable innovator. Every identity choice they make reinforces what the name started.

Your brand deserves the same coherence. Start by getting the name right, then build everything else to amplify it.
