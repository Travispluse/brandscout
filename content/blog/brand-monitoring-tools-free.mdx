## Why Brand Monitoring Matters

Every day, people may be talking about your brand — or misusing it. Brand monitoring helps you:

- Catch negative reviews before they spiral
- Find unauthorized use of your brand name
- Discover partnership and PR opportunities
- Track competitors
- Understand public sentiment

You don't need enterprise software to start. These free tools cover the basics.

## Google Alerts

**Cost:** Free
**Best for:** Web mention tracking

Google Alerts is the simplest brand monitoring tool. Set up an alert for your brand name, and Google emails you whenever it finds new matches in search results.

### How to Set Up

1. Go to google.com/alerts
2. Enter your brand name (use quotes for exact matches: "Your Brand")
3. Choose frequency (as-it-happens, daily, or weekly)
4. Select sources (news, blogs, web, video, etc.)
5. Enter your email
6. Create the alert

### Tips

- Create alerts for common misspellings of your brand
- Set alerts for your personal name and key employees
- Monitor competitor names too

## Google Search Console

**Cost:** Free
**Best for:** Understanding how people find your brand in search

Search Console shows you:
- What queries bring people to your site
- Which pages rank for brand-related keywords
- If there are indexing issues affecting your brand pages

## Social Mention / Social Searcher

**Cost:** Free tier available
**Best for:** Social media mention tracking

These tools scan social platforms for mentions of your brand name. Track sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and find conversations you should join.

## Talkwalker Alerts

**Cost:** Free
**Best for:** Alternative to Google Alerts with broader coverage

Talkwalker Alerts works like Google Alerts but sometimes catches mentions Google misses. Use both for comprehensive coverage.

### Setup

1. Visit talkwalker.com/alerts
2. Enter your search query
3. Choose result type and language
4. Set frequency
5. Enter your email

## Mention.com

**Cost:** Free trial, then paid plans
**Best for:** Comprehensive social and web monitoring

Mention offers a free trial that lets you experience real-time monitoring across social media, blogs, forums, and news sites. If the free trial proves valuable, the paid plan starts at $29/month.

## Reddit and Forum Monitoring

**Cost:** Free
**Best for:** Finding unfiltered opinions

People discuss brands honestly on Reddit. Search for your brand name on:
- Reddit.com (use the search function and sort by new)
- Specific subreddits related to your industry
- Other forums in your niche

Set up Google Alerts with "site:reddit.com your brand name" for automated Reddit monitoring.

## Review Monitoring

**Cost:** Free
**Best for:** Customer feedback tracking

Monitor these platforms manually or with alerts:
- **Google Reviews** — Check your Google Business Profile regularly
- **Yelp** — Set up business owner alerts
- **Trustpilot** — Claim your profile for notifications
- **Industry-specific sites** — G2, Capterra, TripAdvisor, etc.

## Image Monitoring

**Cost:** Free
**Best for:** Finding unauthorized use of your brand images

Use Google Reverse Image Search:
1. Upload your logo or product images
2. See where they appear online
3. Identify unauthorized usage

TinEye is another free option for reverse image searching.

## Building a Free Monitoring System

Combine multiple free tools for comprehensive coverage:

1. **Google Alerts** — Web mentions and news
2. **Talkwalker Alerts** — Additional web coverage
3. **Social Searcher** — Social media mentions
4. **Google Search Console** — Search performance
5. **Review platforms** — Customer feedback
6. **Google Reverse Image Search** — Image monitoring

Spend 15 minutes each morning checking these. It's a small investment that can prevent big problems.

## When to Upgrade to Paid Tools

Consider paid brand monitoring when:
- You're getting too many mentions to track manually
- You need sentiment analysis at scale
- You require real-time alerts (not daily digests)
- You need to report brand metrics to stakeholders

Popular paid options: Brandwatch, Sprout Social, Brand24, Hootsuite.
