# Brand Name A/B Testing: How to Let Data Choose Your Name

Choosing a brand name feels subjective — but it doesn't have to be. A/B testing lets you put real data behind your naming decision. Here's how to test brand name candidates before committing.

## Why A/B Test Brand Names?

### Remove Subjectivity
Founders and teams argue endlessly about names because everyone has opinions. Data resolves debates objectively.

### Validate with Your Actual Audience
What sounds good in a conference room might not resonate with customers. Testing reveals real audience preferences.

### Reduce Risk
A brand name is a multi-year commitment. Spending a few hundred dollars on testing prevents expensive rebrands later.

## Method 1: Landing Page Tests

### How It Works
Create simple landing pages for each name candidate. Drive equal traffic to each and measure engagement.

### Setup
1. Create 2-4 minimal landing pages (one per name candidate)
2. Each page has the brand name, a one-line description, and a CTA (email signup, "Learn More" button, etc.)
3. Use identical designs — only the name changes
4. Drive traffic via social media ads or Google Ads

### What to Measure
- **Click-through rate** from ads to the page
- **Time on page** — Do visitors stay longer for one name?
- **Email signup rate** — Which name generates more interest?
- **Bounce rate** — Which name makes people leave immediately?

### Budget
$200-500 in ad spend across 3-7 days typically generates enough data for a decision.

## Method 2: Social Media Ad Tests

### How It Works
Run identical ads changing only the brand name. Facebook, Instagram, and Google Ads all support A/B testing natively.

### Setup
1. Create ad variations with different names but identical creative and copy
2. Set equal budgets for each variation
3. Target the same audience for all variations
4. Run for 3-5 days minimum

### What to Measure
- **Click-through rate (CTR)** — The strongest signal of name appeal
- **Cost per click (CPC)** — Lower CPC suggests higher relevance
- **Ad relevance score** — Platform-assigned quality metric

## Method 3: Survey Testing

### How It Works
Show name candidates to respondents and measure reactions through structured questions.

### Platforms
- **PickFu** — Quick, affordable consumer polls ($50-200)
- **Pollfish** — Survey targeting specific demographics
- **SurveyMonkey** — Custom surveys with audience panels
- **UsabilityHub** (now Lyssna) — Preference tests and first-impression tests

### Questions to Ask
1. "Which name would you be most likely to click on?" (forced choice)
2. "What do you think [name] does?" (open-ended association)
3. "Rate each name on memorability (1-5)"
4. "Which name feels most trustworthy?"
5. "How would you spell [name] after hearing it once?"

### Best Practices
- Test with your actual target demographic, not friends and family
- Use a minimum sample of 50+ respondents per name
- Include your competitor names as benchmarks

## Method 4: Social Listening

### How It Works
Post your name candidates on social media and measure organic engagement.

### Where to Test
- **Twitter/X polls** — Quick engagement data from followers
- **Instagram Stories polls** — Visual comparison with swipe metrics
- **LinkedIn polls** — B2B audience preferences
- **Reddit** — Post in relevant subreddits for unfiltered feedback

### Limitations
Self-selected audiences may not represent your customers. Use social listening to supplement, not replace, controlled testing.

## How to Interpret Results

### Clear Winner
If one name outperforms by 20%+ across multiple metrics, you have your answer.

### Close Results
If names perform within 10% of each other, other factors (domain availability, trademark, personal preference) become the tiebreaker.

### Surprising Results
Sometimes your least favorite name wins the test. Respect the data unless you have a strong strategic reason to override it.

## What Not to Test

- **Spelling variations** of the same name (too similar to differentiate)
- **More than 5 names at once** (splits data too thin)
- **Names you're not willing to use** (wastes budget)

## After Testing: Check Availability

Once data picks your winning name, confirm it's available across the digital landscape.

Use [BrandScout](/) to check your winning name across domains and social platforms. Validate availability before making your final commitment.
