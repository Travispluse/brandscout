## Why You Need This Checklist

Choosing a brand name feels like the hard part. But validation is where most founders cut corners — and pay for it later with legal issues, lost traffic, and embarrassing discoveries. Run through every item on this list before you announce your name publicly.

## Availability Checks

### 1. .com Domain Available
Check if yourbrand.com is available. If taken, evaluate alternatives (.co, .io) or modified versions (getbrand.com, trybrand.com).

### 2. Social Media Handles Available
Check availability on Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, and any platform relevant to your industry.

### 3. Handle Consistency
Can you get the same (or very similar) handle across all platforms? Inconsistency confuses customers.

### 4. App Store Name Available
If you'll have a mobile app, check both Apple App Store and Google Play for name conflicts.

### 5. Google Business Profile Available
Search your intended name on Google to ensure no local business has already claimed it in your area.

## Legal Checks

### 6. US Trademark Search
Search the USPTO database (tess2.uspto.gov) for identical and similar marks in your product/service category.

### 7. State Trademark Search
Some trademarks are registered at the state level. Check your state's trademark database.

### 8. International Trademark Search
If you plan to operate internationally, search WIPO's Global Brand Database.

### 9. Business Name Registration
Check your state's Secretary of State website to verify no existing business is registered with the same name.

### 10. Legal Entity Compatibility
Confirm your chosen name works as an LLC, Corp, or other business entity. Some names are restricted or require additional permissions.

## Linguistic Checks

### 11. Pronunciation Test
Can ten different people pronounce it correctly when reading it for the first time?

### 12. Spelling Test
Can ten different people spell it correctly after hearing it spoken?

### 13. Phone Test
Say the name over the phone. Can someone understand it without spelling it out?

### 14. Foreign Language Screening
Check for unintended meanings in Spanish, French, German, Mandarin, Japanese, Portuguese, Arabic, and Hindi — at minimum.

### 15. Slang Check
Search Urban Dictionary and social media for any slang meanings you might not be aware of.

## Strategic Checks

### 16. Competitor Differentiation
Does the name stand out from competitors? List it alongside ten competitor names. Does it blend in or pop?

### 17. Industry Appropriateness
Does the name fit your industry's conventions? A playful name might work in fashion but fail in financial services.

### 18. Scalability
Can the name accommodate future products, services, or markets? Does it limit you to one geography, product, or audience?

### 19. Target Audience Resonance
Have you tested the name with actual members of your target audience? What's their immediate reaction?

### 20. Emotional Response
What feelings does the name evoke? Are they aligned with your brand positioning?

## Practical Checks

### 21. Visual Test
How does the name look in your intended logo style? In a URL bar? As a social media handle? On a business card?

### 22. Email Address
Does hello@yourbrand.com look professional? Is it easy to dictate over the phone?

### 23. Search Engine Test
Google the name. What shows up? Any problematic associations, negative news, or dominant competitors?

### 24. Voice Assistant Test
Say the name to Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. Can they understand it and return relevant results?

### 25. Future-Proofing
Will this name still work in five years? Ten? Avoid trendy naming conventions that will date quickly.

## Scoring Your Name

Go through each item and rate:
- ✅ **Pass** — No issues
- ⚠️ **Concern** — Minor issue, manageable
- ❌ **Fail** — Significant problem, reconsider

**20+ passes:** Strong name. Proceed with confidence.
**15-19 passes:** Decent name. Address the concerns before launch.
**Under 15 passes:** Reconsider this name. The gaps will cause problems.

## The Most Common Oversight

The item most frequently skipped on this checklist is #14 — foreign language screening. It's the one that generates the most embarrassing stories. Don't skip it.

## Run the Checklist Fast

Many of these checks can be done in minutes with the right tools. Domain availability, social handle checks, and basic trademark screening don't require hours of manual research.
