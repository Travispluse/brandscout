## The Short Answer: You Can't Copyright a Brand Name

This surprises many founders: brand names, slogans, and titles cannot be copyrighted. Copyright protects creative works — books, music, art, software code. It does not protect short phrases, names, or titles.

The correct protection for brand names is **trademark law**, not copyright law. Understanding the difference prevents costly mistakes.

## Copyright vs Trademark vs Patent

### Copyright
- **Protects:** Original creative works (books, music, art, photos, software, videos)
- **Duration:** Life of author + 70 years (or 95 years for works for hire)
- **Registration required?** No — copyright exists automatically upon creation. Registration strengthens enforcement.
- **Cost:** $35-65 to register
- **Relevant for brand names?** No

### Trademark
- **Protects:** Words, phrases, symbols, and designs identifying goods/services
- **Duration:** As long as the mark is used in commerce (renewed every 10 years)
- **Registration required?** No — rights begin with use. Registration provides stronger protection.
- **Cost:** $250-350 per class to register
- **Relevant for brand names?** Yes — this is your primary protection

### Patent
- **Protects:** Inventions, processes, and designs
- **Duration:** 20 years (utility patents) or 15 years (design patents)
- **Registration required?** Yes — must be approved by the USPTO
- **Cost:** $5,000-15,000+ including attorney fees
- **Relevant for brand names?** No (but design patents can protect unique logo designs)

## What Copyright DOES Protect for Your Brand

While your brand name isn't copyrightable, other brand assets are:

### Logo Artwork
The artistic design of your logo is automatically copyrighted upon creation. This is separate from trademark protection — copyright protects the artwork itself, while trademark protects its use as a brand identifier.

### Website Content
Your website copy, blog posts, and original images are copyrighted. Competitors can't copy your About page text or product descriptions.

### Marketing Materials
Brochures, videos, photographs, and advertising copy are all copyrighted creative works.

### Brand Guidelines Documents
Your brand style guide, if sufficiently creative, is copyrightable.

## What Trademark Protects

### Your Brand Name
The word or words used to identify your business, products, or services.

### Your Logo
As a trademark (not just copyright), protecting its use as a brand identifier.

### Your Tagline/Slogan
Short phrases used consistently as brand identifiers ("Just Do It," "Think Different").

### Product Names
Individual product or service names within your brand portfolio.

### Trade Dress
The overall visual appearance of your product or packaging (think Coca-Cola's bottle shape).

## Common Misconceptions

### "I copyrighted my business name"
No, you didn't. You might have trademarked it (or registered your business entity), but copyright doesn't apply to names.

### "My brand name is automatically protected"
Partially true. Common law trademark rights begin when you start using a name in commerce. But these rights are limited geographically and harder to enforce than registered trademarks.

### "If I register my domain, the name is legally mine"
Domain registration is a lease, not intellectual property protection. It doesn't prevent others from using the same name for their business.

### "I need to mail myself a copy to prove ownership"
The "poor man's copyright" (mailing yourself a sealed copy) has no legal standing. Proper registration is the only reliable way to establish a record.

## The Brand Protection Stack

For comprehensive brand protection, you need multiple layers:

1. **Trademark registration** — Protects your brand name, logo, and tagline
2. **Domain registration** — Secures your web presence
3. **Social media handles** — Secures your social presence
4. **Copyright registration** — Protects your logo artwork and content (optional but strengthens enforcement)
5. **Business entity registration** — Registers your legal business name with the state

## Action Steps

1. **Trademark your brand name** — This is your most important IP protection. File with the USPTO.
2. **Register copyright for your logo** — Optional but provides statutory damages in infringement cases.
3. **Secure your domain and social handles** — Not legal protection, but practical brand defense.
4. **Consult an IP attorney** — If your brand is central to your business (it usually is), professional guidance is worth the investment.

## Verify Before You Protect

Before investing in legal protection, verify your brand name is actually available. Use [BrandScout](/) to check trademarks, domains, and social handles in one search — ensuring the name you want to protect is truly yours to claim.
