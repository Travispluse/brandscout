# Brand Name Legal Checklist: Protect Your Name Before You Launch

Choosing a brand name is a creative exercise. Protecting it is a legal one. Before you print business cards or build a website, work through this legal checklist to ensure your name is defensible and protected.

## Pre-Launch Legal Checklist

### 1. Trademark Search
- [ ] Search the USPTO database (tess2.uspto.gov) for identical and similar marks
- [ ] Search EUIPO if operating in Europe
- [ ] Search WIPO Global Brand Database for international conflicts
- [ ] Search state trademark databases
- [ ] Consider hiring a trademark attorney for a comprehensive search

### 2. Business Name Registration
- [ ] Search your state's secretary of state database
- [ ] Check county DBA (Doing Business As) filings
- [ ] Register your business name with appropriate authorities
- [ ] File a DBA if operating under a name different from your legal entity

### 3. Domain Name Clearance
- [ ] Verify the domain isn't being used by a similar business
- [ ] Check WHOIS for the domain owner's identity
- [ ] Ensure you're not infringing on a trademarked domain

### 4. Social Media Clearance
- [ ] Verify your chosen handles aren't being used by similar businesses
- [ ] Document the current state of each handle (available, inactive, active competitor)

## Trademark Registration Process

### When to File
File your trademark application as soon as you're committed to the name. You can file based on "intent to use" before actually launching.

### What to File
- **Wordmark**: Protects the name itself regardless of design
- **Design mark**: Protects a specific logo or stylized version
- **File the wordmark first** — it provides broader protection

### Trademark Classes
Choose the appropriate Nice Classification classes for your goods/services. Filing in the wrong class leaves gaps in protection.

### Timeline and Cost
- USPTO filing fee: $250-350 per class
- Review period: 3-6 months
- Total registration time: 8-12 months (if no opposition)
- Attorney fees (recommended): $500-2,000+

## Common Legal Pitfalls

### Similarity, Not Just Identical
Trademarks protect against confusingly similar names, not just exact copies. "Googel" would infringe on Google. Consider phonetic similarity, visual similarity, and meaning similarity.

### Industry Overlap Matters
Identical names can coexist in different industries (Delta Airlines vs Delta Faucets). But if there's any audience overlap, conflicts arise.

### Geographic Limitations
An unregistered trademark may only be protected in the geographic area where it's used. Federal trademark registration extends protection nationwide.

### First to Use vs First to File
In the US, trademark rights come from use in commerce, not just registration. But registration provides significant legal advantages.

## Ongoing Legal Protection

- [ ] Monitor for new trademark filings that conflict with yours
- [ ] Set up Google Alerts for your brand name
- [ ] Monitor domain registrations similar to yours
- [ ] Enforce your trademark when infringement occurs (failure to enforce can weaken your mark)
- [ ] Renew your trademark registration (between 5th and 6th year, then every 10 years)

## International Considerations

If you plan to operate internationally:
- File trademark applications in target countries (trademarks are territorial)
- Consider the Madrid Protocol for multi-country filing
- Research your name's meaning in local languages

## Verify Availability First

Before spending on legal protection, verify your name is available across the digital landscape.

Use [BrandScout](/) to check your brand name across domains and social platforms. Confirm digital availability, then invest in legal protection for a name you know you can use.
