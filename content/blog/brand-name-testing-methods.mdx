## Why Testing Matters

Your brand name might sound perfect to you and terrible to your customers. Testing bridges this gap. Here are seven methods that go beyond asking friends and family for opinions.

## Method 1: The Phone Test

Call 10 people and say: "I'm starting a company called [name]." Then ask them to spell it back. If more than 20% get it wrong, your name has a spelling problem.

### Why It Works
This simulates real-world word-of-mouth. When someone recommends your brand verbally, the listener needs to find you online. If they can't spell the name, they can't find you.

### What to Watch For
- Confusion between similar sounds (C/K, S/Z, PH/F)
- Added or dropped letters
- People asking you to repeat the name

## Method 2: The Five-Second Association Test

Show someone your brand name for five seconds. Remove it. Ask them to write down the first three words or images that came to mind.

### Why It Works
First impressions are formed in seconds. This test reveals what your name actually communicates — which may be very different from what you intended.

### How to Analyze
Map all responses into themes. If you're launching a wellness brand and 60% of respondents wrote "technology" or "finance," your name is sending the wrong signal.

## Method 3: The Competitor Lineup Test

Place your name in a list alongside 8-10 competitor names. Show the list to people unfamiliar with the market. Ask: "Which company would you want to learn more about?"

### Why It Works
Your name doesn't exist in isolation. It exists alongside competitors. This test measures distinctiveness and appeal in context.

### Variation
Ask respondents which name they'd trust most, which seems most innovative, and which they'd be most likely to remember tomorrow.

## Method 4: The Crowdsourced Survey

Use platforms like Pollfish, UserTesting, or even Google Forms to survey 50-100 people from your target demographic. Present 3-5 finalist names and ask:

- Which name is most memorable?
- Which name sounds most trustworthy?
- What do you think each company does?
- Which name would you click on in a search result?

### Pro Tip
Don't reveal which names you prefer. Present them in random order. And never ask "Which do you like best?" — people don't buy things they "like." They buy things they trust.

## Method 5: The Google Ad Test

Create simple Google Ads for each name candidate, each pointing to a landing page. Run them for a week with identical budgets and messaging. Compare click-through rates.

### Why It Works
This is the most objective test possible. Real people making real choices with real intent. Higher click-through rate = more compelling name.

### Setup
- Create a separate landing page for each name
- Write identical ad copy except for the brand name
- Target the same keywords and audiences
- Run for 5-7 days with equal budgets

## Method 6: The Domain and Handle Test

Before testing appeal, test availability. The most beloved name is useless if you can't own the .com, the Instagram handle, or the trademark.

Use [BrandScout](/) to run a comprehensive availability check across all platforms. Eliminate unavailable names before spending money on other tests.

## Method 7: The Time Decay Test

Write your top 3 names on a sticky note and put it on your monitor. Look at it every morning for one week. Don't think about it actively — just notice which name you gravitate toward over time.

### Why It Works
Some names grow on you. Others wear off. The first impression test captures initial reactions; the time decay test captures lasting appeal. The best names perform well in both.

## How to Combine These Methods

Use this testing sequence:

1. **Domain/Handle test** — Eliminate unavailable names first
2. **Phone test** — Eliminate names people can't spell
3. **Five-second association test** — Eliminate names with wrong associations
4. **Competitor lineup test** — Ensure your finalists stand out
5. **Crowdsourced survey** — Get quantitative data on 3-5 finalists
6. **Google Ad test** — (Optional) Get real-world performance data
7. **Time decay test** — Make your final decision

## Don't Skip the Fundamentals

Testing is only valuable if your candidates pass the basic requirements first. Before any of these methods, verify that each name is available, spellable, pronounceable, and free of trademark conflicts.

Start with [BrandScout](/) to confirm availability, then test the survivors using the methods above. You'll make a confident, data-informed naming decision.
