## The Naming Decision

You've decided to launch a brand. Now you need a name. You have three paths: hire a naming agency, work with a freelancer, or do it yourself. Each has tradeoffs, and the right choice depends on your budget, timeline, and the stakes involved.

## Option 1: Naming Agency

### What You Get
Professional naming agencies follow a structured process:
1. Discovery and strategy workshop
2. Competitive and linguistic analysis
3. Name generation (often 100+ candidates)
4. Screening and shortlisting
5. Trademark preliminary search
6. Domain availability check
7. Consumer testing (sometimes)
8. Final presentation with strategic rationale

### Cost
$15,000-75,000 for boutique agencies. $75,000-250,000+ for top-tier firms like Lexicon (named BlackBerry, Swiffer), Igor (named Trulia), or Landor.

### Timeline
6-12 weeks typically. Some agencies offer expedited processes for a premium.

### Pros
- Deep expertise in linguistics, trademark law, and brand strategy
- Rigorous process reduces risk of missing problems
- Creative firepower — teams of professional namers
- Strategic rationale for every recommendation
- Trademark pre-screening built into the process

### Cons
- Expensive — prohibitive for most startups
- Slow — weeks of process when you might need a name in days
- You might disagree with all their recommendations
- No guarantee the names will "feel right" despite being strategically sound
- Process can feel overly corporate for scrappy founders

### Best For
Companies with significant budgets where the brand name is a critical competitive asset — consumer packaged goods, automotive, pharmaceuticals, major tech products.

## Option 2: Freelance Naming Specialist

### What You Get
A condensed version of the agency process from an independent professional. Fewer candidates, less testing, but still expert guidance.

### Cost
$2,000-15,000 depending on experience and scope.

### Timeline
2-6 weeks.

### Pros
- Professional expertise at a fraction of agency cost
- More personal attention than at a large agency
- Faster and more flexible process
- Often includes basic trademark and domain screening

### Cons
- Quality varies widely — vet carefully
- Less creative bandwidth than a full agency team
- Limited testing and consumer research capabilities
- May not have deep trademark law knowledge

### Best For
Small to mid-size businesses that take naming seriously but can't justify agency pricing.

## Option 3: DIY Naming

### What You Get
Full creative control. You generate candidates, screen them, test them, and make the final call.

### Cost
$0-500 (mainly domain registration and trademark search fees).

### Timeline
A few hours to a few weeks, depending on your process.

### Pros
- No cost beyond your time
- Complete creative control
- Fastest possible timeline
- Nobody knows your brand better than you
- Tools like BrandScout make DIY validation fast and reliable

### Cons
- No expert perspective on linguistic or cultural pitfalls
- Risk of confirmation bias (falling in love with a problematic name)
- May miss trademark conflicts without legal expertise
- Limited creative range — you only have your own perspective

### Best For
Bootstrapped startups, MVPs, side projects, and founders who enjoy the creative process and are willing to invest time in research.

## A Hybrid Approach

Many founders find the best results come from combining approaches:

1. **DIY the strategy and brainstorming.** Nobody understands your brand's purpose and audience better than you.
2. **Use tools for validation.** Check domain availability, social handles, and basic trademark screening using automated tools.
3. **Hire an expert for review.** Pay a freelance naming specialist $500-1,000 to review your top three candidates for linguistic risks and strategic fit.
4. **Consult a trademark attorney.** Before filing, spend $500-1,500 on a proper trademark search and filing.

This approach costs $1,000-3,000 total and captures most of the value of an agency process.

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Agency | Freelancer | DIY |
|--------|--------|------------|-----|
| Budget | $15K+ | $2-15K | $0-500 |
| Timeline | 6-12 weeks | 2-6 weeks | 1 day - 2 weeks |
| Expertise | Highest | Moderate | Varies |
| Creative range | Widest | Moderate | Limited |
| Control | Lowest | Moderate | Highest |
| Risk | Lowest | Low-moderate | Moderate |

## The Most Common Mistake

The biggest naming mistake isn't choosing the wrong approach — it's not validating the name before committing. Whether you use an agency or DIY, every name needs availability checking across domains, social media, and trademark databases.
