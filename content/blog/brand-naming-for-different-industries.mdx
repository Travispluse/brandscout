# Brand Naming for Different Industries: What Works Where

Every industry has its own naming conventions, customer expectations, and competitive dynamics. A name that works perfectly for a tech startup might fall flat for a law firm. Here's how to tailor your naming approach by industry.

## Technology

Tech brands favor short, invented words: Stripe, Slack, Notion, Figma. The tech audience is comfortable with abstract names and values brevity. Key patterns:

- **Invented words** that feel modern and ownable
- **Action verbs** that imply transformation (Zoom, Snap, Shift)
- **Short names** under 7 characters for clean URLs and handles
- **.io and .ai extensions** are widely accepted

## Healthcare

Healthcare naming must balance approachability with trust. Patients need to feel safe; professionals need to feel competent.

- **Clinical credibility** — Names shouldn't feel flippant
- **Warmth** — Avoid cold, overly technical names for patient-facing brands
- **Regulatory awareness** — Some terms are restricted in healthcare marketing
- **Latin/Greek roots** signal medical expertise (Moderna, Novartis)

## Food and Beverage

Food brands connect through sensory and emotional associations:

- **Evocative names** that trigger taste or feeling (Sweetgreen, Innocent)
- **Origin stories** — Place names and founder names build authenticity
- **Simple, speakable names** — People order food out loud
- **Playful names** work for casual dining; refined names for upscale

## Financial Services

Finance requires trust above all else. Naming conventions reflect stability and authority:

- **Strong, established-sounding names** (Vanguard, Fidelity, Goldman)
- **Avoid trendy names** that might feel unstable
- **Fintech exception** — Disruptor brands use approachable names (Venmo, Robinhood, Chime)
- **Compound words** that imply growth or security

## Fashion and Beauty

Fashion naming is aspirational, often using:

- **Founder names** (Chanel, Gucci, Glossier from Emily Weiss)
- **Foreign words** — French and Italian names signal sophistication
- **Abstract elegance** — Short, visually appealing names
- **Lowercase aesthetic** for modern brands (glossier, everlane)

## Real Estate

Real estate brands balance local trust with aspiration:

- **Location references** ground the brand locally
- **Aspiration words** — Summit, Pinnacle, Compass
- **Founder names** signal personal accountability
- **Team names** for real estate groups

## Education

Education brands need to feel both credible and accessible:

- **Knowledge metaphors** — Academy, Institute, Workshop
- **Approachable names** for consumer ed-tech (Duolingo, Coursera)
- **Authority names** for professional education

## Finding What Works for You

Whatever your industry, the fundamentals remain: your name must be available, memorable, and appropriate for your audience.
