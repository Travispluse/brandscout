## When Two Brands Become One (Sort Of)

Brand partnerships are powerful growth levers. Nike + Apple Watch. Spotify + Starbucks. Uber + Spotify. But every partnership raises a naming question: how do two brands share space without diminishing either one?

## Types of Brand Partnerships

### Co-Branded Products
Two brands appear on one product. Both names are visible.

**Examples:** Doritos Locos Tacos (Doritos + Taco Bell), Nike Air Jordan (Nike + Michael Jordan's brand), GoPro + Red Bull content.

**Naming approach:** Both brand names appear, usually with the product host brand first: "Taco Bell Doritos Locos Tacos."

### Ingredient Branding
One brand's component is featured inside another brand's product.

**Examples:** Intel Inside (Intel + PC manufacturers), Gore-Tex (Gore + apparel brands), Dolby Atmos.

**Naming approach:** The ingredient brand appears as a secondary endorsement, often with its own logo badge.

### Joint Ventures
Two companies create a new entity together.

**Examples:** Sony Ericsson (now dissolved), Hulu (originally Disney + NBC + Fox), Molson Coors.

**Naming approach:** Often a combined name or an entirely new name. Combined names work when both parent brands are strong and complementary.

### Licensing Partnerships
One brand licenses its name to another for specific products.

**Examples:** Porsche Design (licensed for sunglasses, luggage), Ferrari clothing, Star Wars merchandise.

**Naming approach:** The licensor's name appears prominently; the licensee's name may be minimized or hidden.

## Naming Principles for Partnerships

### 1. Decide on Hierarchy
Every partnership has a power dynamic. Whose brand leads? Options:
- **Equal billing:** "Brand A × Brand B" (the multiplication sign signals collaboration)
- **Host + Guest:** "Brand A, featuring Brand B" or "Brand A with Brand B"
- **New name:** A completely new name for the collaboration

Equal billing works when both brands are similarly positioned. Host + Guest works when one brand is clearly the platform and the other is the addition.

### 2. Maintain Individual Brand Integrity
Each brand should remain recognizable within the partnership. Don't blend names into unrecognizable combinations. "NikePro" could be a Nike product line. "NiApple" is nonsensical.

### 3. Define Usage Rules
Document in the partnership agreement:
- How each brand name is displayed (size, position, color)
- Whether the partnership has its own name/logo
- Who approves marketing materials
- What happens to naming if the partnership ends

### 4. Consider the Customer's Perspective
Does the naming make sense to someone encountering it for the first time? If customers need an explanation of the partnership name, it's too complicated.

## When Partnerships Create New Names

Some collaborations deserve their own distinct name:

**When to create a new name:**
- The partnership produces something fundamentally new
- Neither parent brand should be limited by the collaboration
- The partnership might outlast the parent brands' involvement

**How to name it:**
- Keep it simple and related to the partnership's purpose
- Ensure both parent brands endorse or are credited
- Check availability independently — the partnership name needs its own domain and handles

## Protecting Your Brand in Partnerships

### Pre-Partnership Naming Audit
Before entering a partnership:
- Verify the partner's brand is legitimate and well-regarded
- Check for any negative associations
- Ensure your brand names look good together visually
- Confirm there are no trademark conflicts between your brands

### Partnership Agreement Essentials
Include these naming-related clauses:
- Brand usage guidelines for both parties
- Approval processes for co-branded materials
- What happens to naming/branding when the partnership ends
- Who owns any new names, logos, or IP created during the partnership
- Geographic and temporal limitations on name usage

### Exit Strategy
Partnerships end. Plan for it:
- How will co-branded products be handled post-partnership?
- Will any shared names or assets transfer to one party?
- Is there a transition period for removing co-branding?

## The Partnership-Ready Brand

Strong partnerships start with strong individual brands. Before collaborating, make sure your own brand name is distinctive, well-positioned, and secured across all platforms.
