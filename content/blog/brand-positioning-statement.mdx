## What Is a Brand Positioning Statement?

A brand positioning statement is an internal document — typically one to two sentences — that defines your brand's unique place in the market. It's not a tagline or slogan. It's the strategic foundation that informs everything from naming to messaging to product decisions.

Without clear positioning, you're competing on price. With it, you're competing on meaning.

## The Classic Positioning Formula

The most widely used template comes from Geoffrey Moore's "Crossing the Chasm":

**For [target audience] who [need or opportunity], [brand name] is the [category] that [key benefit] because [reason to believe].**

Let's break down each component.

### Target Audience
Be specific. "Everyone" is not a target audience. "First-time founders who need to name their startup in under a week" is.

### Need or Opportunity
What problem are they trying to solve or what goal are they trying to achieve? Frame this from the customer's perspective, not yours.

### Brand Name
Your name should fit naturally into the statement. If it sounds awkward or requires explanation, that could signal a naming issue.

### Category
What competitive frame do you occupy? Are you a "brand name generator," a "naming consultancy," or an "all-in-one brand validation tool"? The category you choose shapes who you're compared against.

### Key Benefit
The single most compelling benefit you offer. Not three benefits. One. The one that matters most to your target audience.

### Reason to Believe
Why should anyone believe your claim? This could be your technology, methodology, track record, or unique approach.

## Real-World Examples

**Slack:** For teams who need to communicate at work, Slack is the collaboration hub that replaces email with organized, searchable conversations because it integrates with the tools teams already use.

**Tesla:** For environmentally conscious drivers who refuse to compromise on performance, Tesla is the electric vehicle brand that proves sustainability and excitement aren't mutually exclusive because of its industry-leading battery technology and design.

## How Positioning Connects to Naming

Your brand name is the most compressed expression of your positioning. Consider how these names reinforce positioning:

- **Square** (simple, accessible payments) — The name itself implies simplicity
- **Robinhood** (democratized investing) — The name communicates the populist mission
- **Lululemon** (premium athleisure) — The playful sound signals a lifestyle brand, not a utility

If your positioning says "premium" but your name sounds budget, there's a disconnect that will cost you credibility.

## Writing Your Positioning Statement

### Step 1: Research Your Market
Identify three to five direct competitors. How do they position themselves? Where are the gaps?

### Step 2: Interview Customers
Ask your best customers why they chose you over alternatives. Their language often reveals your true positioning better than internal brainstorming.

### Step 3: Draft Multiple Versions
Write at least five variations. Each one will emphasize different aspects of your brand. Read them aloud. The one that feels most true and differentiated is usually the winner.

### Step 4: Pressure Test It
Share your statement with team members, advisors, and a few trusted customers. Ask: "Does this feel accurate? Does it feel different from competitors? Would this influence your decision?"

### Step 5: Finalize and Distribute
Put it somewhere everyone can access it — a shared doc, your brand guidelines, your onboarding materials. Every piece of marketing copy should be traceable back to this statement.

## Common Positioning Mistakes

**Being too broad.** "We help businesses grow" positions you against literally everyone. Narrow down until it feels almost uncomfortable.

**Copying competitors.** If your positioning statement could belong to three other companies, it's not positioning — it's describing the category.

**Focusing on features over outcomes.** Nobody cares about your technology. They care about what it enables. "AI-powered" is a feature. "Find your brand name in seconds" is an outcome.

**Never updating it.** Positioning should be reviewed as your market and audience evolve. What worked at launch may not work at scale.

## Positioning Before Everything Else

Your positioning statement should precede every other branding decision — name, logo, website, messaging. It's the compass that keeps everything aligned.
