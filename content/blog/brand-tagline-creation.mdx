# Brand Tagline Creation: Write a Slogan People Remember

"Just Do It." "Think Different." "Because You're Worth It." Great taglines become inseparable from their brands. While not every business needs a tagline, the right one can crystallize your brand's promise in a few unforgettable words.

## What Makes a Great Tagline

### Brevity
The best taglines are under 7 words. Nike's "Just Do It" is three. Apple's "Think Different" is two. Brevity forces clarity.

### Emotional Connection
Taglines that make people feel something are remembered. "Because You're Worth It" (L'Oréal) speaks to self-worth. "Open Happiness" (Coca-Cola) promises joy.

### Brand Promise
A tagline should encapsulate what the brand delivers. "Melts in Your Mouth, Not in Your Hands" (M&M's) is a clear product promise.

### Uniqueness
Your tagline should be ownable — not interchangeable with competitors. "Quality You Can Trust" could be any brand. "The Happiest Place on Earth" is distinctly Disney.

## Tagline Formulas That Work

### The Imperative
A command that inspires action:
- "Just Do It" (Nike)
- "Think Different" (Apple)
- "Eat Fresh" (Subway)

### The Descriptive
Describes the brand experience:
- "The Breakfast of Champions" (Wheaties)
- "The Ultimate Driving Machine" (BMW)
- "Finger Lickin' Good" (KFC)

### The Provocative
Challenges or surprises:
- "Is It In You?" (Gatorade)
- "What's in Your Wallet?" (Capital One)
- "Got Milk?" (California Milk Board)

### The Aspirational
Points to a better future:
- "Because You're Worth It" (L'Oréal)
- "Impossible Is Nothing" (Adidas)
- "A Diamond Is Forever" (De Beers)

## Step-by-Step Tagline Creation

### Step 1: Define Your Core Promise
What single thing do you want customers to associate with your brand?

### Step 2: List Key Benefits
Write down every benefit your product/service provides. Circle the most compelling one.

### Step 3: Write 50 Variations
Quantity breeds quality. Write at least 50 tagline options before evaluating any.

### Step 4: Apply the Bar Test
Read each tagline to someone in a noisy bar. Which ones are understood and remembered?

### Step 5: Sleep on It
Great taglines feel right after 48 hours, not just in the brainstorming moment.

### Step 6: Test with Your Audience
Survey your target customers. Which tagline resonates most?

## When You Don't Need a Tagline

Many successful brands operate without taglines:
- Your brand name is already descriptive
- You're too early-stage (a tagline can limit pivots)
- Your product speaks for itself
- A tagline would feel forced

## Tagline and Brand Name Synergy

Your tagline should complement, not repeat, your brand name. "Apple: Think Different" works because Apple is abstract. "Fresh Foods: Eat Fresh" would be redundant.

## Build Your Complete Brand

A great tagline builds on a great brand name. Start by ensuring your name is available and consistent across all platforms.
