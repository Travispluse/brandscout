## What Is Brand Voice?

Brand voice is your brand's personality expressed through words. It's consistent across every piece of communication — website copy, emails, social media, customer support, packaging.

If your brand were a person at a dinner party, how would they talk? That's your voice.

## Voice vs. Tone: The Critical Distinction

**Voice** stays constant. It's who you are. **Tone** shifts based on context.

A brand with a friendly, knowledgeable voice might use an encouraging tone in onboarding emails but a serious tone in a data breach notification. The personality stays the same — the emotional register adapts.

Think of it like a person: your friend has a consistent personality but speaks differently at a funeral than at a birthday party.

## How to Define Your Brand Voice

### Step 1: Start With Your Brand Name and Values

Your name already signals something. A brand called "Spark" implies energy and directness. A brand called "Sage" implies wisdom and calm. Your voice should amplify what your name starts.

List your three to five core brand values. These are the foundation of your voice.

### Step 2: Choose Three Voice Attributes

Pick three adjectives that describe how your brand communicates. Be specific — "professional" is too vague. Better examples:

- **Confident, not arrogant** — We state things directly but never talk down to people.
- **Warm, not casual** — We're friendly and approachable but still polished.
- **Clear, not simplistic** — We explain complex things simply without dumbing them down.

The "not" qualifier prevents misinterpretation and gives writers guardrails.

### Step 3: Create a "This, Not That" Chart

For each voice attribute, provide examples:

| We Sound Like This | Not Like This |
|---|---|
| "Here's how to fix that." | "As per our documentation, users should reference..." |
| "Great question!" | "Obviously..." |
| "We made a mistake. Here's what we're doing about it." | "We regret any inconvenience caused." |

### Step 4: Write Sample Copy

Draft examples of your voice across different formats:
- A homepage headline
- A tweet / social post
- A customer support reply
- An error message
- An email subject line

These examples become the clearest reference for anyone writing on behalf of your brand.

## Defining Tone Variations

Create a tone spectrum for different situations:

### Celebratory (product launches, milestones)
More energetic, exclamation-appropriate, emoji-friendly

### Informative (blog posts, guides)
Balanced, helpful, confident but not hype-driven

### Supportive (customer service, troubleshooting)
Patient, empathetic, solution-focused

### Serious (outages, sensitive topics, policy changes)
Direct, transparent, no jokes or casual language

## Building the Guide Document

Your brand voice guide should include:

1. **Brand overview** — One paragraph on who you are and what you stand for
2. **Voice attributes** — Your three descriptors with "not" qualifiers
3. **Tone variations** — How voice adapts across contexts
4. **Word list** — Words you use and words you avoid (e.g., "customers" not "users," "simple" not "easy")
5. **Grammar preferences** — Oxford comma or not, contractions or not, emoji policy
6. **Sample copy** — Real examples across formats
7. **Common mistakes** — Things new writers get wrong

Keep it under five pages. Nobody reads a fifty-page brand guide.

## Applying Your Voice Consistently

### Audit Existing Content
Review your website, emails, and social media. Highlight anything that doesn't match your defined voice. Fix the biggest offenders first.

### Train Your Team
Share the guide with everyone who writes for your brand — marketing, support, sales, leadership. Walk through examples together.

### Create Templates
For frequently used formats (support replies, social posts, email campaigns), create templates that bake in the right voice.

### Review Regularly
Schedule quarterly reviews of your voice guide. As your brand evolves, your voice may need refinement.

## Your Voice Starts With Your Name

A memorable, well-chosen brand name makes voice development easier because it already carries personality. Before building your voice guide, make sure your name is working for you.
