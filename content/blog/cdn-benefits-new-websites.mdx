## What Is a CDN?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers distributed worldwide that cache and deliver your website's content from locations closest to your visitors. Instead of every request traveling to your origin server in one location, visitors load your site from a nearby CDN server.

## Why New Websites Need a CDN

### Speed

Page speed directly impacts conversions. Studies consistently show:

- A one-second delay reduces conversions by 7%
- 53% of mobile visitors leave if a page takes longer than three seconds
- Google uses page speed as a ranking factor

A CDN can reduce load times by 50% or more for visitors far from your server.

### Reliability

CDNs distribute traffic across multiple servers. If one server goes down, others pick up the load. For a new brand, website downtime during a launch or marketing push can be catastrophic.

### Global Reach

If your brand serves customers internationally, a CDN is essential. Without one, a visitor in Tokyo accessing your New York-hosted site experiences significant latency. With a CDN, they load from a Tokyo edge server.

### Security

Most CDNs include DDoS protection, bot filtering, and web application firewalls. This protects your site from attacks without extra configuration.

## How a CDN Works

1. A visitor in London requests yourbrand.com
2. Instead of reaching your server in New York, the request goes to a CDN edge server in London
3. If the London server has a cached copy of your page, it serves it instantly
4. If not, it fetches the page from your origin server, serves it, and caches it for future requests

This happens automatically. Your visitors don't notice anything except faster load times.

## Popular CDN Options

## Setting Up Cloudflare (Step by Step)

For most new brand websites, Cloudflare is the easiest choice:

1. Create a free Cloudflare account
2. Add your domain
3. Cloudflare scans your existing DNS records
4. Update your nameservers at your registrar to Cloudflare's
5. Wait for propagation (usually under an hour)
6. Enable SSL and configure caching rules

That's it. Your site is now behind a global CDN.

## What a CDN Caches

**Static content** (always cached):
- Images, CSS, JavaScript files
- Fonts and media files
- PDF documents

**Dynamic content** (optionally cached):
- HTML pages
- API responses
- Personalized content (usually not cached)

## CDN and SEO

CDNs improve SEO indirectly through:

- **Faster load times** — Google's Core Web Vitals benefit
- **Better uptime** — Fewer crawl errors
- **SSL support** — HTTPS as a ranking signal
- **Reduced server load** — Your origin server can handle more crawl requests

## Common CDN Mistakes

- **Not purging cache after updates** — Visitors see old content. Most CDNs offer easy cache purging.
- **Caching personalized content** — User-specific pages shouldn't be cached. Configure cache rules carefully.
- **Ignoring mobile optimization** — CDN helps speed but doesn't fix unoptimized images or code
- **Over-caching** — Setting very long cache times means updates take longer to appear

## Do You Need a CDN if You Use a Website Builder?

If you're on Shopify, Squarespace, or Wix, they include CDN-like infrastructure. You may not need an additional CDN. But if you're on WordPress or a custom platform, adding a CDN is strongly recommended.

## Your CDN Checklist

- [ ] CDN provider selected
- [ ] Domain configured to route through CDN
- [ ] SSL enabled through CDN
- [ ] Caching rules configured
- [ ] Cache purging tested
- [ ] Performance tested from multiple locations

Before optimizing delivery with a CDN, secure the right domain for your brand. Use [BrandScout](/) to find available domains and build your online presence on a fast, reliable foundation.
