## Why Check Before You File

Filing a trademark application costs $250-350 per class. If a conflicting mark already exists, your application will be refused and you lose the fee. A thorough availability search takes 30 minutes and can save you hundreds of dollars and months of wasted time.

## Step 1: Search the USPTO Database (TESS)

The Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) is the USPTO's free database of registered and pending trademarks.

### How to Search
1. Go to tess2.uspto.gov
2. Select "Basic Word Mark Search (New User)"
3. Enter your brand name
4. Review results for identical or similar marks

### What to Look For
- **Exact matches** in your goods/services category — this is a clear conflict
- **Similar-sounding names** — "phonetic equivalents" can block your registration
- **Similar names in related categories** — "likelihood of confusion" extends beyond identical classes
- **Dead marks** — marks that have been cancelled or abandoned may still pose issues if the owner is still using them

### Search Tips
- Search for variations: singular/plural, with/without spaces, phonetic spellings
- Use wildcard searches: "brand*" catches "brandname," "brandly," etc.
- Check both "Live" and "Dead" marks — dead marks that are still in use retain common law rights

## Step 2: Search State Trademark Databases

Federal registration (USPTO) isn't the only trademark system. Each state has its own trademark registry. A brand operating only within one state may have state-level trademark rights that don't appear in the USPTO database.

Most state registries are searchable online through the Secretary of State's website.

## Step 3: Search Common Law Uses

A business can have trademark rights without any registration — simply by using a name in commerce. To find unregistered marks:

- **Google the name** + your industry keywords
- **Search social media** for businesses using the name
- **Check business directories** (Yelp, Yellow Pages, industry-specific directories)
- **Search state business registries** for entity names

A common law trademark won't appear in the USPTO database but can still block your registration if the owner challenges it.

## Step 4: Search International Databases

If you plan to operate internationally, check:

- **WIPO Global Brand Database:** globalbranddb.wipo.int (covers international registrations)
- **EUIPO TMview:** Covers EU trademarks
- **Canadian Trademarks Database:** ic.gc.ca
- **Country-specific databases** for your target markets

## Step 5: Analyze Likelihood of Confusion

Even if you don't find an exact match, your mark could be refused if it's "confusingly similar" to an existing mark. The USPTO considers:

### Similarity of the Marks
- Sound: Do they sound alike when spoken? ("Coach" vs "Koach")
- Appearance: Do they look alike when written? ("Klear" vs "Clear")
- Meaning: Do they mean the same thing? ("Monarch" vs "King")

### Similarity of Goods/Services
- Are the products/services related? (Clothing and accessories are related; clothing and industrial chemicals are not)
- Would consumers expect them to come from the same source?

### Strength of the Existing Mark
- Famous marks (Nike, Apple) have broader protection
- Descriptive marks have narrower protection

## Clearance Levels

### Green Light (Likely Available)
- No identical or similar marks found in your category
- No common law uses in your industry
- Name is distinctive (not descriptive of your goods/services)

### Yellow Light (Proceed With Caution)
- Similar (not identical) marks exist in related categories
- Dead marks exist that might still be in use
- The name is somewhat descriptive

### Red Light (High Risk)
- Identical or very similar marks exist in your category
- A famous mark exists regardless of category
- The name describes your goods/services directly
