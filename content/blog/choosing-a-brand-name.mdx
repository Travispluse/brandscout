# How to Choose the Perfect Brand Name in 2026

Choosing a brand name is one of the most consequential decisions you'll make for your business. It shapes first impressions, affects discoverability, and determines whether people can find you online.

## Start with Availability

Before falling in love with a name, check if it's actually available. That means:

- **Domain availability** — Can you get the .com? What about .io or .co?
- **Social handles** — Is @yourname taken on GitHub, Reddit, Twitter, and other platforms?
- **Trademark conflicts** — Is someone already using this name in your industry?

Tools like BrandScout make this instant. Enter your name and see availability across 7 TLDs and 6+ platforms in seconds.

## Keep It Short and Readable

The best brand names are:

- **5–12 characters** — easy to type, easy to remember
- **Pronounceable** — if people can't say it, they can't share it
- **Free of numbers and hyphens** — these look unprofessional in domains

## Consider Variations

If your first choice is taken, don't despair. Try:

- Adding a prefix: **get**, **try**, **go**, **use**
- Adding a suffix: **hq**, **app**, **hub**, **lab**
- Shortening or combining words

## Think Long-Term

Your brand name should work whether you're a startup or a Fortune 500. Avoid names that lock you into a specific product or geography.
