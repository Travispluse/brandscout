## Why Analyze Competitor Names?

Your brand name exists in context. It's heard alongside competitors, listed next to them in search results, and compared against them in purchasing decisions. Understanding the competitive naming landscape helps you stand out rather than blend in.

## The Competitor Naming Audit

### Step 1: List Your Competitors

Gather fifteen to twenty competitor names across three tiers:
- **Direct competitors:** Same product, same market
- **Indirect competitors:** Different product, same need
- **Aspirational competitors:** Where you want to be in five years

### Step 2: Categorize Each Name

Most brand names fall into these categories:

- **Descriptive:** Names that say what the company does (General Electric, PayPal)
- **Invented:** Made-up words (Kodak, Xerox, Spotify)
- **Metaphorical:** Real words used symbolically (Amazon, Apple, Uber)
- **Founder names:** Named after people (Ford, Bloomberg, Dell)
- **Acronyms:** Shortened from longer names (IBM, BMW, AT&T)
- **Compound:** Two words combined (Facebook, YouTube, WordPress)

Map out which categories dominate your industry.

### Step 3: Identify Naming Patterns

Look for trends:
- Are most names one syllable or three?
- Do they tend to be abstract or descriptive?
- Are they modern-sounding or classic?
- Do they use similar word roots or suffixes?
- What emotions do they collectively evoke?

These patterns reveal industry conventions — the naming "language" your audience is used to hearing.

### Step 4: Find the Gaps

The most valuable insight from competitor analysis isn't what everyone's doing — it's what nobody's doing. If every competitor uses descriptive, multi-syllable names, a short invented word will stand out. If everyone sounds techy, a warm human name creates contrast.

## What to Look For

### Sound Patterns
Map the phonetic qualities of competitor names. Are they mostly hard consonants (Stripe, Block, Bolt) or soft sounds (Loom, Aura, Calm)? Choosing the opposite creates instant differentiation.

### Visual Distinctiveness
Type all competitor names in the same font and size. Which ones catch your eye? Which disappear? Notice how letter shapes, length, and capital letters affect visual impact.

### Emotional Territory
What feelings do competitor names evoke? If every name in your space feels cold and technical, there's an emotional gap for warmth and personality.

### Domain and URL Patterns
How do competitors handle their domain names? Exact match, modified, or completely different? Understanding the landscape helps you set realistic expectations for your own domain.

## Building Your Competitive Naming Map

Create a simple 2x2 matrix with dimensions relevant to your industry:

- X-axis: Descriptive ←→ Abstract
- Y-axis: Serious ←→ Playful

Plot each competitor name on the map. Identify which quadrants are crowded and which are empty. The empty quadrants represent your differentiation opportunity.

## Using Analysis to Generate Names

With your competitive analysis complete, you can now brief name generation with precision:

"We need a name that is [opposite of dominant pattern], feels [emotion missing from the landscape], and is [length/style] to differentiate from [specific competitors]."

This brief produces better candidates than "we need a cool name."

## Competitive Analysis Mistakes

**Only analyzing direct competitors.** Your audience encounters brands across categories. A B2B SaaS name competes for mental space with every brand your customer interacts with daily.

**Trying to sound like the market leader.** If Salesforce dominates your space, naming yourself "SalesForge" doesn't make you seem competitive — it makes you seem derivative.

**Ignoring defunct competitors.** Check for failed companies with similar names. Their reputation might linger and contaminate your brand.

**Analyzing names in isolation.** Always evaluate competitor names alongside your candidates. How does your name look in a list next to theirs?

## Take Action

Competitive naming analysis gives you strategic clarity. You'll know exactly where the opportunities are and what kind of name will make you stand out.
