# Crowdsourcing Your Brand Name: Platforms, Strategies, and Pitfalls

Can the crowd name your brand better than you can? Crowdsourcing has produced winning names for major companies — and spectacular failures for others. Here's how to use it effectively.

## What Is Naming Crowdsourcing?

Crowdsourcing your brand name means soliciting name suggestions from a large group — whether through dedicated platforms, social media, or your existing community. You're leveraging diverse perspectives to find ideas you might never generate alone.

## Platforms for Crowdsourced Naming

### Squadhelp
The largest naming contest platform. Post a brief, set a prize ($100-$500+), and receive hundreds of name suggestions from a global community of naming enthusiasts. Includes trademark screening and audience testing.

### Naming Force
Similar to Squadhelp with a community of professional namers. Contests run for a set period with guaranteed prizes.

### 99designs (NamingForce)
Primarily known for design, 99designs also offers naming contests through their NamingForce service.

### Reddit
Subreddits like r/namenerds, r/business, and industry-specific communities can generate creative suggestions — for free.

### Twitter/X
Posting "Help me name my startup" to your followers can generate surprisingly good results, especially if you have an engaged audience.

## How to Run a Successful Naming Contest

### Write a Detailed Brief
The quality of submissions directly correlates with brief quality. Include:
- What your business does (in plain language)
- Target audience
- Brand personality and values
- Names you like (and why)
- Names you dislike (and why)
- Must-haves (length, style, tone)
- Deal-breakers (specific words, styles to avoid)

### Set Appropriate Prizes
Higher prizes attract more and better submissions. For Squadhelp, $200-$300 is standard; $500+ attracts top-tier namers.

### Engage Actively
Rate submissions, provide feedback, and steer the creative direction throughout the contest. Passive contest holders get worse results.

### Run Multiple Rounds
Many platforms support multiple rounds. Use Round 1 for broad exploration and Round 2 to refine the best directions.

## Crowdsourcing Through Your Community

### Social Media Polls
Post your shortlist and let followers vote. This generates engagement AND market validation simultaneously.

### Email Your List
If you have an email list, send a naming survey. Existing customers often provide the most relevant feedback.

### Focus Groups
Recruit a small group from your target audience for a naming session. In-person or video calls allow deeper exploration than polls.

## Advantages of Crowdsourcing

### Diversity of Perspectives
Hundreds of people from different backgrounds, cultures, and industries generate ideas you'd never think of alone.

### Market Validation
If your community participates in naming, they feel ownership of the brand. This creates built-in advocates.

### Cost-Effective
Naming agencies charge $15,000-$75,000+. Crowdsourcing contests cost $100-$500. The quality gap has narrowed significantly.

### Speed
Contests typically run 3-7 days. You get hundreds of options in under a week.

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### Design by Committee
Too many opinions create indecision. Use the crowd for generation, not final selection. The founder(s) should make the final call.

### Ignoring Availability
Crowdsourced names are rarely checked for domain or trademark availability before submission. Many winning names turn out to be unavailable.

### Legal Issues
Ensure your contest terms include IP assignment — the winning namer must transfer all rights to the name. Reputable platforms handle this automatically.

### Bias Toward Cleverness
Crowds often favor clever wordplay over practical brandability. A name that's fun to create might not be fun to use as a business name.

### Too Many Options
Receiving 500 suggestions can be overwhelming. Develop scoring criteria before the contest ends to evaluate systematically.

## Evaluating Crowdsourced Names

Score each finalist on:
- **Memorability** (1-5) — Would you remember it after hearing it once?
- **Relevance** (1-5) — Does it connect to your business?
- **Pronunciation** (1-5) — Can everyone say it correctly?
- **Availability** (pass/fail) — Domain, social handles, trademark
- **Uniqueness** (1-5) — Does it stand out from competitors?

## Check Availability Before You Decide

The single most important step after crowdsourcing: verify that your winning name is actually available.

Use [BrandScout](/) to instantly check any name across domains and social platforms. Don't fall in love with a name you can't actually use.
