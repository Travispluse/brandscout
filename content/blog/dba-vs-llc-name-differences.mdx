## Two Names, Two Purposes

Many business owners are confused by the difference between their LLC name and their DBA. They're both "business names," but they serve completely different functions. Understanding the distinction helps you structure your brand correctly from day one.

## What's an LLC Name?

Your LLC name is your legal entity name — the name on your Articles of Organization filed with the state. It's used for:

- Legal contracts and agreements
- Bank accounts
- Tax filings
- Lawsuits and legal proceedings
- Official government correspondence

**Example:** Fresh Bake Holdings LLC

### Requirements
- Must include "LLC," "L.L.C.," or "Limited Liability Company"
- Must be unique in your state's business registry
- Must follow your state's naming rules

## What's a DBA?

A DBA (Doing Business As) — also called a fictitious name, trade name, or assumed name — is a public-facing name that differs from your legal entity name. It's used for:

- Marketing and branding
- Storefront signage
- Website and social media
- Customer-facing communications
- Business cards and marketing materials

**Example:** FreshBake (operating under Fresh Bake Holdings LLC)

### Requirements
- Must be registered with your state or county (varies by jurisdiction)
- Filing fee: typically $10-100
- Some states require publication in a local newspaper
- Must be renewed periodically (every 5-10 years in most states)

## When You Need a DBA

### Your LLC Name Doesn't Match Your Brand
This is the most common reason. Your legal name might be "Smith Digital Marketing LLC," but you want to market under "PixelForge."

### You Operate Multiple Brands
One LLC can operate multiple brands under different DBAs:
- Parent LLC: Creative Ventures Holdings LLC
- DBA 1: PixelForge (design agency)
- DBA 2: ContentLab (content marketing)
- DBA 3: BrandSpark (branding consultancy)

### You're a Sole Proprietor or Partnership
If you're not incorporated, you typically need a DBA to operate under any name other than your personal legal name.

### Your LLC Name Is Too Long or Formal
"Sacramento Valley Premium Window Installation Services LLC" is a fine legal name but terrible for marketing. A DBA like "ValleyView Windows" solves this.

## When You DON'T Need a DBA

If your LLC name *is* your brand name, you don't need a DBA. Many modern businesses register their LLC with their brand name directly:

- LLC name: FreshBake LLC
- Brand name: FreshBake
- No DBA needed

This is simpler and cheaper. If you can do it, do it.

## How to Choose Each Name

### LLC Name Strategy
- **Option A: Brand-First.** Use your brand name as your LLC name: "FreshBake LLC." Simple, clean, no DBA needed.
- **Option B: Holding Company.** Use a generic holding company name: "Fresh Bake Holdings LLC." Then register brand-specific DBAs. Good for multi-brand businesses.
- **Option C: Founder-Based.** Use your name: "Smith Enterprises LLC." Register brand DBAs as needed.

### DBA Name Strategy
Your DBA should be your actual brand name — the name customers know and search for. It should:
- Match your domain name
- Match your social media handles
- Be memorable and brandable
- Be checked for trademark conflicts (a DBA registration does NOT provide trademark protection)

## The Critical Warning: DBAs Don't Protect Your Name

**A DBA registration does NOT give you trademark rights.** It only notifies the public that your LLC operates under that name. Someone in another state — or even your own state — can use the same name without violating your DBA.

For real name protection, you need a trademark registration (federal via USPTO or state-level).

## How to Register a DBA

### Step 1: Check Availability
Search your state or county's business name database to ensure the DBA isn't already taken.

### Step 2: File the Registration
- **Some states:** File with the Secretary of State
- **Other states:** File with the county clerk
- **Cost:** $10-100 depending on jurisdiction

### Step 3: Publish (If Required)
Some states (California, New York, others) require you to publish your DBA filing in a local newspaper. This adds $40-200 to the cost.

### Step 4: Open a Bank Account
With your DBA certificate, you can open a business bank account under your DBA name.

## The Name Stack for Most Businesses

Here's how a typical business structures its names:

| Layer | Name | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Legal entity | FreshBake LLC | Contracts, taxes, legal |
| DBA (if different) | FreshBake | Customer-facing brand |
| Domain | freshbake.com | Website |
| Social handles | @freshbake | Social media |
| Trademark | FRESHBAKE® | Legal brand protection |

## Get the Brand Name Right First

Your DBA, domain, and social handles should all match. Before filing anything, verify your brand name is available everywhere. Use [BrandScout](/) to check domains, social media handles, and trademarks in one search — then set up your LLC and DBA with confidence.
