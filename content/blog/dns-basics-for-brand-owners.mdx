## What Is DNS and Why Should You Care?

DNS stands for Domain Name System. It's the internet's phone book — it translates human-readable domain names (yourbrand.com) into IP addresses (192.168.1.1) that computers use to find websites.

As a brand owner, you don't need to become a DNS expert. But understanding the basics helps you manage your website, email, and online services without depending entirely on tech support.

## How DNS Works (Simply)

1. Someone types yourbrand.com into their browser
2. Their computer asks a DNS server: "What's the IP address for yourbrand.com?"
3. The DNS server responds with the IP address
4. The browser connects to that IP address and loads your website

This happens in milliseconds, thousands of times a day for every website on the internet.

## Key DNS Records Every Brand Owner Should Know

### A Record

Points your domain to an IP address. This is the most fundamental record — it tells the internet where your website lives.

**Example:** yourbrand.com → 104.21.55.123

### CNAME Record

Points a subdomain to another domain name. Commonly used for "www" and third-party services.

**Example:** www.yourbrand.com → yourbrand.com

### MX Record

Directs email to your mail server. Without MX records, email sent to you@yourbrand.com won't arrive.

**Example:** yourbrand.com → mail.google.com (for Google Workspace)

### TXT Record

Stores text information. Used for email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and domain verification.

**Example:** Proving to Google that you own yourbrand.com for Search Console.

### NS Record

Specifies which name servers are authoritative for your domain. Usually set automatically by your domain registrar.

## Where to Manage Your DNS

DNS can be managed at:

1. **Your domain registrar** (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains)
2. **A dedicated DNS provider** (Cloudflare, Route 53, DNSimple)
3. **Your web host** (if they manage DNS for you)

Many brand owners use Cloudflare for DNS because it's free, fast, and includes DDoS protection.

## Common DNS Tasks for Brand Owners

### Connecting Your Domain to a Website

When you build a website on Squarespace, WordPress, or Shopify, you'll need to point your domain to their servers. This involves:

1. Adding an A record or CNAME record provided by your website builder
2. Waiting for propagation (usually under an hour, sometimes up to 48 hours)

### Setting Up Email

To use email with your custom domain (you@yourbrand.com):

1. Add MX records from your email provider
2. Add TXT records for SPF and DKIM authentication
3. Verify the setup by sending a test email

### Verifying Domain Ownership

Services like Google Search Console and Facebook Business require you to prove you own your domain by adding a specific TXT record.

## DNS Propagation

When you change DNS records, the update doesn't happen instantly. DNS propagation — the time it takes for changes to spread across the internet — can take:

- **Minutes** with providers like Cloudflare
- **Up to 48 hours** in worst cases

During propagation, some users may see the old site and others the new one. This is normal.

## DNS Security Basics

### DNSSEC

DNS Security Extensions authenticate DNS responses, preventing attackers from redirecting your visitors to malicious sites. Enable DNSSEC through your registrar if available.

### Lock Your Domain

Enable registrar lock (clientTransferProhibited) to prevent unauthorized domain transfers. This is a basic but essential security measure.

### Use Two-Factor Authentication

Protect your registrar and DNS provider accounts with 2FA. If someone gains access to your DNS, they control your entire online presence.

## DNS Mistakes to Avoid

- **Deleting records you don't understand** — If you're unsure, don't delete it
- **Long TTL values for records you change frequently** — Lower TTL means faster propagation
- **Forgetting to update DNS when switching providers** — Your site goes down
- **Not backing up DNS records** — Screenshot or export your records periodically

## Your DNS Checklist

- [ ] Domain registered and accessible
- [ ] DNS managed by a reliable provider
- [ ] A/CNAME records pointing to your website
- [ ] MX records configured for email
- [ ] SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records set up
- [ ] DNSSEC enabled
- [ ] Domain transfer lock enabled
- [ ] 2FA on registrar account

Before managing DNS, you need the right domain. Use [BrandScout](/) to find an available domain for your brand, then set up DNS to bring it to life.
