# When to Hire a Domain Broker (And When to DIY)

You want a specific domain, but someone else owns it. Should you reach out yourself or hire a professional broker? The answer depends on the domain's value, your negotiation skills, and how much your identity matters.

## What Domain Brokers Do

Domain brokers are intermediaries who negotiate domain purchases on your behalf. They contact the owner, handle negotiations, manage escrow, and facilitate the transfer. Good brokers have industry relationships and market knowledge that individual buyers lack.

## When to Hire a Broker

### The Domain Is Worth $10,000+

For high-value acquisitions, broker expertise pays for itself. They know market pricing and can prevent you from overpaying — or help you avoid lowball offers that insult the seller.

### You're a Recognizable Brand

If you're Apple, reaching out directly to buy "apple-products.com" signals desperation and drives the price up. Brokers provide anonymity, keeping the seller from knowing who's really buying.

### You've Been Ignored

Some domain owners don't respond to emails from strangers. Brokers have established relationships with domain investors and know how to get responses.

### You Lack Negotiation Experience

Domain negotiation has its own dynamics. Brokers understand seller psychology, pricing anchors, and timing strategies that maximize your chances of success.

### Time Is Critical

If you're launching soon and need the domain quickly, a broker's established processes and connections can accelerate the timeline.

## When to Handle It Yourself

### The Domain Is Under $5,000

Broker commissions (typically 10-15%) eat into small purchases. On a $2,000 domain, you'd pay $200-300 in fees — money better spent elsewhere.

### The Domain Is Listed on a Marketplace

If the domain has a "buy it now" price on Dan.com or Afternic, there's nothing to negotiate. Just buy it directly.

### You Have Negotiation Skills

If you're comfortable with business negotiations and can remain patient and unemotional, DIY is perfectly viable.

### The Owner Is Clearly an Individual

Non-professional domain owners (someone who registered the domain for a project they abandoned) are often easier to negotiate with directly. A friendly email explaining your plans can work wonders.

## How to Choose the Right Broker

### Look for Track Record

Ask for references and verified sales history. Reputable brokers include MediaOptions, Grit Brokerage, and VPN.com.

### Understand Fee Structures

Most brokers charge a commission (10-15% of the sale price) paid by the buyer. Some charge flat fees or offer hybrid models. Clarify fees upfront.

### Check Communication Style

Your broker represents you. Choose someone who is professional, responsive, and transparent. Ask how often they'll update you on progress.

### Avoid Upfront Fees

Legitimate brokers work on commission. Be wary of anyone asking for significant upfront payments before any work is done.

## The Broker Process

1. **Consultation** — You share the domain you want and your budget
2. **Research** — Broker assesses the domain's value and owner
3. **Outreach** — Broker contacts the owner anonymously
4. **Negotiation** — Multiple rounds of offers and counteroffers
5. **Agreement** — Both parties agree on price and terms
6. **Escrow** — Funds are secured through escrow
7. **Transfer** — Domain changes hands, broker takes commission

The typical timeline is 2-8 weeks, though complex negotiations can take months.

## DIY Negotiation Tips

If you decide to go it alone:

- **Use a generic email** — Don't use your company domain
- **Be brief and professional** — One short paragraph expressing interest
- **Don't reveal your budget** — Let the seller name the first price
- **Be patient** — Sellers often need time to decide
- **Always use escrow** — Never send payment directly

## Before You Spend on a Domain

Whether you hire a broker or negotiate yourself, first confirm that your brand name is viable across the entire digital landscape.

Run your name through [BrandScout](/) to check domain availability across multiple TLDs and social media platforms. You might find your ideal .com is taken but discover a great alternative — saving you thousands in broker fees.
