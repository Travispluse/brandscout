# What Happens When a Domain Expires: The Complete Timeline

Domain expiration is one of the most common — and most preventable — disasters in online business. Understanding the lifecycle helps you protect your domains and, potentially, acquire expired ones.

## The Domain Expiration Timeline

### Day 0: Expiration Date
Your domain reaches its expiration date. What happens next depends on your registrar and settings:
- **With auto-renewal**: The registrar charges your card and renews. Crisis averted.
- **Without auto-renewal (or failed payment)**: The expiration process begins.

### Days 1-30: Grace Period
Most registrars offer a grace period (typically 0-45 days, varies by registrar) where you can renew at the normal price. During this period:
- Your website may go down or show a registrar parking page
- Email may stop working
- The domain is still yours — you just need to renew

### Days 30-60: Redemption Period
If you don't renew during the grace period, the domain enters redemption. You can still recover it, but:
- **Redemption fees are steep**: $80-200+ on top of the renewal price
- The domain is locked from transfer
- It may take longer to restore full functionality

### Days 60-65: Pending Delete
After redemption expires, the domain enters a 5-day pending delete phase. During this period:
- You can no longer recover the domain
- The domain is queued for release back to the public
- Backorder services prepare to catch it

### Day ~65: Domain Drops
The domain is deleted from the registry and becomes available for anyone to register. Backorder services and manual registrations compete to grab it.

## What Happens to Your Website and Email

### Website
Your site goes offline the moment DNS stops resolving. This can happen:
- On the expiration date (some registrars)
- After a few days grace (other registrars)
- The registrar may display ads on your domain during grace/redemption periods

### Email
Email to your domain bounces. This means:
- Customer communications are lost
- Password reset emails for linked accounts fail
- Business operations are disrupted

### SEO Impact
- Search engines notice your site is down within days
- Extended downtime causes ranking drops
- Backlinks to your domain lose value
- Recovery can take weeks to months after re-registration

## How to Prevent Domain Expiration

1. **Enable auto-renewal** on every domain you own
2. **Keep payment methods current** — update credit cards before they expire
3. **Use a reliable email** for your registrar account — one you actually check
4. **Register important domains for multiple years** (5-10 years)
5. **Set calendar reminders** 60 and 30 days before expiration
6. **Monitor domain status** through your registrar dashboard
7. **Use a domain management spreadsheet** tracking all your domains

## Recovering an Expired Domain

If your domain has expired:
1. **Act immediately** — Contact your registrar
2. **Grace period**: Renew normally through your registrar dashboard
3. **Redemption period**: Pay the redemption fee (contact registrar support)
4. **After deletion**: Try to re-register, but others may be faster
