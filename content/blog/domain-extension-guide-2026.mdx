# Domain Extension Guide 2026: Which TLD Should You Choose?

The domain extension you choose sends a signal about your brand before anyone even visits your site. In 2026, there are over 1,500 TLDs to choose from — but only a handful matter for most businesses.

## The TLD Landscape in 2026

Here's the current state of domain extensions and what each signals:

### .com — The Gold Standard
Still the default. If you can get the .com, get it. Period. Users trust it, browsers autocomplete it, and it carries inherent authority. About 50% of all websites use .com.

### .net — The Solid Alternative
Originally for network/internet companies, .net is now a general-purpose alternative when .com is taken. It's recognized and trusted, though less prestigious than .com.

### .org — The Mission-Driven Choice
Best for nonprofits, open-source projects, and community organizations. Using .org for a for-profit business can feel misleading.

### .co — The Startup Favorite
Popular with startups who can't get the .com. Short, clean, and widely recognized thanks to companies like Twitter (t.co). The risk: users might accidentally type .com instead.

### .io — The Developer's Domain
Beloved by tech companies and developer tools. Signals "we're technical." Originally the country code for British Indian Ocean Territory, it's become synonymous with tech products.

### .ai — The AI Era Domain
Exploded in popularity alongside the AI boom. If your product involves artificial intelligence or machine learning, .ai is extremely relevant. Prices tend to be higher ($50-80/year).

### .app — The App Domain
Google's TLD for applications. Requires HTTPS by default (good for security). Clean and modern, perfect for SaaS products and mobile apps.

## How to Choose the Right Extension

Ask yourself these questions:
1. **Is the .com available?** If yes, buy it. Discussion over.
2. **What industry are you in?** Tech → .io or .ai. App → .app. Nonprofit → .org.
3. **Who is your audience?** Non-technical users expect .com. Developer audiences are fine with .io.
4. **What's your budget?** .com and .net are cheapest ($10-15/year). .ai runs $50-80/year.

## Checking Multiple Extensions at Once

Don't check one TLD at a time. Use [BrandScout](https://brandscout.net) to check your brand name across all 7 major TLDs simultaneously — .com, .net, .org, .co, .io, .ai, and .app. You'll see exactly which extensions are available in seconds.

## The Multi-Domain Strategy

Smart brands buy multiple extensions and redirect them all to their primary domain:
- mybrand.com (primary)
- mybrand.net (redirect)
- mybrand.io (redirect)
- mybrand.ai (redirect)

This prevents competitors from squatting on your brand variations and catches users who type the wrong extension.

## Domain Extensions and SEO

Google has stated that TLD choice doesn't directly impact rankings. However, there are indirect effects:

- **.com gets higher click-through rates** in search results (users trust it more)
- **Country-code TLDs** (.uk, .de, .ca) get geo-targeting signals
- **New/unusual TLDs** (.xyz, .guru, .ninja) can look spammy to users

## SEO Best Practices After Choosing Your Domain

Once you've secured your domain, make sure your site is technically optimized. [AuditMySite](https://auditmysite.app) runs 50+ SEO checks for free, covering everything from meta tags to page speed to mobile responsiveness.

## Local Business Considerations

For local businesses like those listed on [SacValley Contractors](https://sacvalleycontractors.com), .com is almost always the right choice. Your customers aren't tech-savvy early adopters — they're homeowners looking for a reliable contractor. A .com domain inspires confidence and is easy to remember.

## Key Takeaways

- .com is still king for most businesses
- .io and .ai are great for tech/AI companies
- Always check availability across multiple TLDs before committing
- Consider buying multiple extensions to protect your brand
- TLD choice doesn't directly affect SEO, but it impacts user trust
