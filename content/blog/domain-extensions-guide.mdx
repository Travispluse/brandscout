# Domain Extensions Explained: .com vs .io vs .ai and More

With hundreds of domain extensions available, choosing the right one matters more than you think.

## The Big Three

### .com
Still the gold standard. If you can get the .com, get it. It carries the most trust and is what people type by default.

### .net
Originally for network infrastructure, now a solid alternative when .com is taken. Well-recognized and trustworthy.

### .org
Traditionally for nonprofits and organizations. Using it for a commercial brand can confuse visitors.

## The Tech Favorites

### .io
Beloved by startups and tech companies. Short, clean, and signals "we're a tech company." One downside: it's technically the country code for British Indian Ocean Territory.

### .ai
Hot right now thanks to the AI boom. Great for AI/ML companies, but also works for any tech brand. It's actually Anguilla's country code.

### .app
Google-owned TLD that requires HTTPS. Clean and modern, great for software products.

## The Wildcard

### .co
Colombia's country code, widely adopted as a .com alternative. Short and professional. Companies like Twitter (t.co) have validated it.

## Which Should You Choose?

1. **Always try .com first** — it's the default
2. **Tech startup?** — .io or .ai are great signals
3. **Building an app?** — .app is purpose-built
4. **Budget option?** — .co and .net are affordable and respected
