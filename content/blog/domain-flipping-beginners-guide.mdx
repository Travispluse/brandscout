## What Is Domain Flipping?

Domain flipping is the practice of registering or buying domain names at low prices and reselling them at higher prices. Think of it as real estate investing, but for internet addresses. Some flippers earn a few hundred dollars per sale; others have made millions on single transactions.

## How the Domain Market Works

The domain aftermarket is a multi-billion dollar industry. Names are bought and sold through:

- **Aftermarket platforms:** Sedo, Afternic, Dan.com
- **Auction sites:** GoDaddy Auctions, NameJet, DropCatch
- **Private sales:** Direct negotiations between buyer and seller
- **Expired domain services:** Catching domains as they expire

## Step 1: Learn What Makes a Domain Valuable

Not all domains are worth buying. Valuable domains share these characteristics:

### Short Length
Shorter is almost always more valuable. Three-letter .com domains sell for $10,000-100,000+. Four-letter .coms sell for $1,000-10,000+. Five-letter pronounceable .coms can be worth $500-5,000.

### Common Words
Single real-word .com domains are the most valuable assets. Even uncommon words can be worth thousands if they're brandable.

### Industry Keywords
Domains containing popular industry keywords (finance, health, tech, real estate) command premiums because businesses will pay to own them.

### Brandability
Short, pronounceable, memorable names that could work as brand names are increasingly valuable. Not every valuable domain is a keyword — some are just great brand names.

### Extension
.com is king for resale value. Other TLDs can be flipped but at lower margins and smaller markets.

## Step 2: Find Domains to Buy

### Hand Registration
Register unregistered domains at standard prices ($10-15). This requires creativity — good .coms are scarce. Focus on:
- New trending topics or technologies
- Compound words that aren't yet registered
- Emerging industry terms

### Expired Domains
Monitor expiring domains using ExpiredDomains.net or DomCop. Domains with existing backlinks and traffic are worth more.

### Aftermarket Bargains
Browse Sedo, Afternic, and GoDaddy Auctions for underpriced domains. Sellers sometimes list names below market value because they need quick cash or don't know their domain's worth.

## Step 3: Evaluate Before Buying

Before spending money, evaluate:

- **Comparable sales:** Search NameBio.com for similar domains that have sold
- **Search volume:** Check Google Keyword Planner for the domain's keywords
- **Brandability:** Would a real business want this name?
- **Legal risk:** Could the name infringe on an existing trademark?
- **Extension value:** Is this TLD actually sellable?

## Step 4: List and Market Your Domains

### Where to List
- **Sedo** — Largest domain marketplace globally
- **Afternic** — Strong distribution network (owned by GoDaddy)
- **Dan.com** — Modern platform with good buyer experience
- **Your own landing page** — Use a "this domain is for sale" page with contact info

### Pricing Strategy
- Research comparable sales on NameBio
- Price at 3-10x what you paid for hand-registered domains
- Set "Buy It Now" prices for fast sales
- Accept offers to start negotiations

### Marketing
- List on multiple platforms simultaneously
- Reach out directly to businesses that could use the domain
- Use domain parking pages that generate ad revenue while you wait for a buyer

## Step 5: Close the Deal

### Payment and Transfer
- Use an escrow service (Escrow.com) for transactions over $500
- For smaller sales, Dan.com handles payment and transfer automatically
- Transfer the domain to the buyer's registrar account
- Provide a receipt and transfer confirmation

## Realistic Expectations

### Typical Margins
- Hand-registered domains: Buy for $10, sell for $100-5,000 (if they sell)
- Expired domains: Buy for $50-500, sell for $500-10,000
- Premium domains: Buy for $1,000-10,000, sell for $5,000-100,000

### Timeline
Most domains take 6-24 months to sell. Some never sell. Domain flipping requires patience and portfolio diversification.

### Success Rate
Experienced flippers estimate that 10-20% of their portfolio sells. The profits from those sales need to cover the registration costs of the other 80%.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

- **Registering too many domains** before selling any
- **Overvaluing your domains** based on emotion rather than data
- **Ignoring renewal costs** — unsold domains cost $10-15/year each
- **Trademark infringement** — registering brand names hoping the company will buy (this is cybersquatting and it's illegal)
- **Chasing trends** that expire before the domain sells

## Tools for Domain Flippers

- **NameBio** — Historical domain sales data
- **Estibot** — Automated appraisals
- **ExpiredDomains.net** — Expired domain lists
- **Ahrefs/Moz** — Backlink analysis for expired domains
- **Google Trends** — Identify rising keywords

## Validate Domain Potential

Before buying any domain to flip, check its potential as a brand name. Use [BrandScout](/) to see if matching social handles are available — domains with matching social availability are worth more to buyers.
