# Domain Hacks: Creative URLs That Make Your Brand Unforgettable

A domain hack uses the domain extension as part of the brand name, creating a clever, memorable URL. Think bit.ly, del.icio.us, or instagr.am. When done right, domain hacks are some of the most memorable URLs on the internet.

## What Is a Domain Hack?

A domain hack combines the domain name and TLD to spell out a word or phrase. Instead of "bitely.com," the URL shortener uses "bit.ly" — where .ly (Libya's country code) completes the word. The entire URL becomes the brand.

## Famous Domain Hacks

- **bit.ly** — URL shortener using Libya's .ly
- **del.icio.us** — Social bookmarking using .us (United States)
- **instagr.am** — Instagram's early URL using .am (Armenia)
- **last.fm** — Music service using .fm (Federated States of Micronesia)
- **about.me** — Personal pages using .me (Montenegro)
- **goo.gl** — Google's URL shortener using .gl (Greenland)
- **is.gd** — URL shortener using .gd (Grenada)

## Extensions Commonly Used in Domain Hacks

### .ly (Libya)
Perfect for words ending in "-ly": quick.ly, instant.ly, friend.ly, beautiful.ly

### .io (British Indian Ocean Territory)
Works for words ending in "-io": stud.io, portfol.io, rat.io

### .me (Montenegro)
Great for personal and action-oriented names: hire.me, about.me, follow.me

### .is (Iceland)
Creates statements: this.is, what.is, who.is

### .to (Tonga)
Implies action: listen.to, go.to, link.to

### .in (India)
Works for words ending in "-in": log.in, plug.in, check.in

### .al (Albania)
For "-al" words: person.al, digit.al, minim.al

### .es (Spain)
For "-es" words: not.es, vot.es, shar.es

## How to Create a Domain Hack

### Step 1: Break Down Your Brand Name
Take your desired brand name or word and look for where a TLD could naturally slot in. Write out the word and try splitting it at different points.

### Step 2: Check TLD Availability
Not all country codes are open for general registration. Some require local presence or have restricted registration policies.

### Step 3: Verify Registration Is Possible
Even if the TLD exists, the specific domain might be taken or restricted. Check availability through your registrar.

### Step 4: Consider Pronunciation
Your domain hack should be easy to say aloud. "Bit dot ly" works. "Bea dot ut dot if dot ul dot ly" doesn't.

## Pros of Domain Hacks

- **Extremely memorable** — Creative URLs stick in people's minds
- **Great for marketing** — Short, clever URLs work perfectly in ads and social media
- **Conversation starters** — People notice and comment on creative domains
- **Often available** — Many creative combinations haven't been registered

## Cons of Domain Hacks

- **Spelling confusion** — People might not understand where the domain name ends and the TLD begins
- **Email issues** — Unusual TLDs can trigger spam filters
- **Country-code risks** — The country's registry controls the TLD and policies can change
- **SEO challenges** — Some country-code TLDs are geo-targeted by search engines, potentially limiting global reach
- **Dictation problems** — Telling someone your URL over the phone is harder with unconventional extensions

## Best Practices

- **Keep it short** — The best domain hacks are under 10 characters total
- **Make it pronounceable** — If you can't say it naturally, it won't work
- **Register the .com too** — As a redirect and for email
- **Test with real people** — Say it out loud, spell it out, see if people get it
- **Check the TLD's stability** — Research the country code's registration policies and history
