## What Is Domain Privacy Protection?

When you register a domain, your personal information — name, address, phone number, email — is stored in a public database called WHOIS. Anyone can look it up. Domain privacy protection replaces your personal details with the registrar's proxy information, keeping you anonymous.

## What WHOIS Exposes Without Privacy

Without domain privacy, anyone who searches your domain's WHOIS record can see:

- Your full legal name
- Your mailing address (often your home)
- Your phone number
- Your email address
- Your domain registration and expiration dates

This information is used by spammers, telemarketers, scammers, and even competitors. Within days of registering a domain without privacy, expect a flood of unsolicited emails and calls.

## How Privacy Protection Works

When you enable domain privacy (also called WHOIS privacy or ID protection), the registrar substitutes your information with their own:

- **Your name** → "Registration Private" or the registrar's proxy name
- **Your address** → The registrar's address
- **Your phone** → A forwarding number or the registrar's number
- **Your email** → A proxy email that forwards to you

Your domain still belongs to you legally. The proxy just masks your public-facing details.

## How Much Does It Cost?

Pricing varies by registrar:

- **Namecheap:** Free with every domain
- **Cloudflare Registrar:** Free with every domain
- **Google Domains (now Squarespace):** Free with every domain
- **GoDaddy:** $10-15/year (or included in higher-tier plans)
- **Network Solutions:** $10-12/year

Many modern registrars include privacy protection free. If your registrar charges for it, consider switching.

## Do You Need Domain Privacy?

### Yes, If:
- **You're an individual or small business** operating from a home address
- **You want to avoid spam** — both email and physical mail
- **Privacy is important to you** for personal safety reasons
- **You run multiple domains** and don't want them linked publicly to your identity
- **You're in a controversial industry** where harassment is a risk

### Maybe Not, If:
- **You're a large corporation** with a public business address anyway
- **You want to signal legitimacy** — some buyers check WHOIS to verify domain ownership
- **You're selling domains** — privacy can make you look like a squatter
- **Legal requirements** mandate public registration info (some countries require it)

## GDPR Changed Everything

Since GDPR took effect in 2018, registrars in the EU (and many globally) automatically redact personal information from WHOIS records for EU residents. This effectively provides free privacy protection for a significant portion of domain registrants.

However, GDPR protections don't apply everywhere, and enforcement varies. Non-EU registrants should still enable explicit privacy protection.

## RDAP: The WHOIS Replacement

WHOIS is being replaced by RDAP (Registration Data Access Protocol), which has built-in access controls. Under RDAP, personal data isn't publicly displayed by default — you need to request access with a legitimate reason.

This transition is ongoing but incomplete. Until RDAP fully replaces WHOIS, privacy protection remains important.

## Common Myths

### "Privacy protection makes my domain less trustworthy"
For website visitors, WHOIS data is invisible — they never see it. Only domain industry professionals check WHOIS. Your site's trustworthiness comes from your content, design, and reputation.

### "Privacy protection affects SEO"
Google does not use WHOIS data as a ranking factor. Privacy protection has zero impact on your search rankings.

### "I'll lose my domain if I use privacy protection"
You remain the legal owner regardless of privacy settings. The proxy is cosmetic, not a transfer of ownership.

### "Privacy protection is illegal"
It's completely legal in virtually all jurisdictions, though some country-code TLDs have restrictions.

## How to Enable Domain Privacy

1. Log into your domain registrar
2. Find the domain management section
3. Look for "WHOIS Privacy," "Domain Privacy," or "ID Protection"
4. Toggle it on

If your registrar doesn't offer it (or charges too much), consider transferring your domain to Cloudflare or Namecheap, where privacy is free.

## Protecting Your Full Brand

Domain privacy protects your personal information. But your brand also needs protection across social media and trademark databases. Use [BrandScout](/) to check your brand name's availability and ensure it's secured everywhere — domains, social handles, and trademarks.
