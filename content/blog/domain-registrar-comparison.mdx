## Why Your Registrar Choice Matters

Your domain registrar is where your most valuable digital asset lives. A bad registrar means surprise fees, poor security, and frustrating interfaces. A good one means transparent pricing, robust security, and peace of mind.

Here's an honest comparison of the top registrars in 2026.

## Cloudflare Registrar

### Pricing
Cloudflare charges wholesale cost — no markup. A .com domain costs whatever Verisign charges ($10.11/year at time of writing). This makes Cloudflare consistently the cheapest option.

### Pros
- **At-cost pricing** — no markup, no surprises
- **Free WHOIS privacy** included
- **No upselling** — clean, no-nonsense interface
- **Excellent DNS** performance (Cloudflare is a DNS company)
- **DNSSEC** support built in

### Cons
- **No first-year discounts** — always at-cost (but this means no renewal price hikes)
- **Limited TLD selection** — doesn't support every TLD
- **Requires Cloudflare account** with at least one site added
- **No domain marketplace** for buying premium domains
- **Minimal domain management features** — basic but functional

### Best For
Tech-savvy users who want the lowest ongoing cost and already use Cloudflare for other services.

## Namecheap

### Pricing
Competitive pricing with frequent promotions. .com domains often available for $8-10/year with renewal at $13-14/year.

### Pros
- **Free WHOIS privacy** (WhoisGuard) with every domain
- **Good UI** — clean and intuitive dashboard
- **Marketplace** for buying and selling domains
- **Email hosting** options available
- **Solid customer support** via live chat
- **Wide TLD selection**

### Cons
- **Renewal prices higher** than first-year promotional rates
- **Some advanced DNS features** lacking compared to Cloudflare
- **Occasional aggressive upselling** in the checkout flow

### Best For
Most users. Good balance of price, features, and usability.

## GoDaddy

### Pricing
Aggressive first-year discounts ($2-5 for .com) but higher renewals ($20-22/year). WHOIS privacy is extra ($10-15/year).

### Pros
- **Largest registrar** — massive selection of TLDs
- **Domain marketplace** and auction platform
- **Website builder** and hosting packages
- **24/7 phone support**
- **Brand recognition** and trust

### Cons
- **Expensive renewals** — the low first-year price is a hook
- **WHOIS privacy costs extra** — most competitors include it free
- **Aggressive upselling** — checkout is a gauntlet of add-ons
- **Cluttered interface** — many features but overwhelming
- **History of security incidents**

### Best For
Non-technical users who want phone support and don't mind paying more long-term.

## Google Domains (Now Squarespace Domains)

### Pricing
Transparent pricing at ~$12/year for .com with no price difference between first year and renewal.

### Pros
- **Transparent pricing** — same price year after year
- **Free WHOIS privacy** included
- **Clean interface** — Google-level design
- **Easy Google Workspace integration**
- **No upselling**

### Cons
- **Acquired by Squarespace** in 2023 — long-term direction uncertain
- **Limited TLD selection** compared to GoDaddy
- **No phone support**
- **Fewer advanced DNS features**

### Best For
Users who value simplicity and predictable pricing.

## Porkbun

### Pricing
Among the cheapest registrars. .com domains at ~$9-10/year with competitive renewals.

### Pros
- **Very affordable** — consistently low prices across TLDs
- **Free WHOIS privacy** included
- **Free email forwarding** and SSL certificates
- **Fun, quirky brand** (yes, that matters for some people)
- **Clean interface**

### Cons
- **Smaller company** — less established than major players
- **Limited support hours**
- **Fewer enterprise features**

### Best For
Budget-conscious users who want a great deal without GoDaddy's upselling.

## Quick Comparison Table

| Feature | Cloudflare | Namecheap | GoDaddy | Squarespace | Porkbun |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| .com price/yr | ~$10 | ~$13 | ~$20 | ~$12 | ~$10 |
| WHOIS privacy | Free | Free | $10-15/yr | Free | Free |
| Upselling | None | Minimal | Heavy | None | Minimal |
| TLD selection | Medium | Large | Largest | Medium | Large |
| UI quality | Good | Good | Cluttered | Excellent | Good |
| DNS quality | Best | Good | Average | Good | Good |

## Our Recommendation

For most people: **Namecheap** or **Cloudflare**. Namecheap offers the best all-around experience. Cloudflare offers the lowest prices if you're comfortable with a more technical setup.

Avoid GoDaddy unless you specifically need their phone support or domain marketplace.

## Before You Register

Before choosing a registrar, make sure the domain you want is actually the right one for your brand. Use [BrandScout](/) to verify your brand name is available across domains, social handles, and trademarks — then register with confidence at your preferred registrar.
