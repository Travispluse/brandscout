# .app Domain Benefits: Why Google's Secure Extension Deserves Your Attention

The .app domain is one of the most thoughtfully designed new extensions available. Backed by Google and with built-in security features, it offers genuine advantages for software companies, mobile app developers, and digital brands.

## What Makes .app Special

### Mandatory HTTPS

Every .app domain requires HTTPS — it's built into the extension at the registry level via HSTS preloading. This means your site can never be served insecurely. For users and search engines alike, this is a trust signal.

### Google Registry Backing

Google operates the .app registry, bringing the infrastructure reliability and trust you'd expect. This also means seamless integration with Google services.

### Clear Purpose

The extension immediately communicates that you're offering a software application or digital product. No ambiguity.

## Who Should Use .app?

- **Mobile app developers** — Perfect for app landing pages and download portals
- **SaaS companies** — Signals a modern, software-first product
- **Web applications** — Clean branding for web-based tools
- **App portfolios** — Companies with multiple apps can use subdomains (product1.yourbrand.app)

## Pricing

.app domains are competitively priced:

- **Standard registration**: $14-20/year
- **Premium names**: $30-10,000+/year (varies by registrar)
- **Renewal**: Generally matches first-year price

This makes .app one of the most affordable premium extensions, significantly cheaper than .io or .ai.

## .app vs Other Extensions

### .app vs .com
.com has broader recognition, but .app provides clearer context for software products. If you're building an app, "yourname.app" is more descriptive than "yourname.com."

### .app vs .io
Both are popular in tech. .io has broader tech credibility, while .app is more specific to software applications. .app is also cheaper.

### .app vs .dev
.dev targets developers specifically. .app targets end users and products. Choose based on your audience — building tools for developers? Use .dev. Building consumer apps? Use .app.

## SEO Considerations

Google treats .app as a generic TLD with no geographic restrictions. It doesn't receive preferential treatment in search results — rankings depend entirely on your content and SEO efforts. However, the mandatory HTTPS is a minor positive ranking factor since Google prioritizes secure sites.

## Setting Up a .app Domain

### Step 1: Register
Purchase through any major registrar. Cloudflare, Google Domains, Namecheap, and GoDaddy all offer .app registration.

### Step 2: Get an SSL Certificate
Because .app requires HTTPS, you need an SSL certificate before your site will load. Let's Encrypt provides free certificates, and most hosting providers include SSL.

### Step 3: Configure DNS
Point your .app domain to your hosting provider using A records or CNAME records, just like any other domain.

### Step 4: Deploy Your Site
Your .app domain works with any hosting provider — Vercel, Netlify, AWS, or traditional hosting.

## Creative Uses for .app Domains

- **getmyapp.app** — App download landing page
- **yourbrand.app** — Primary brand domain for software companies
- **internal.app** — Internal tools and dashboards
- **yourbrand.app/ios** — Subdirectory for platform-specific pages

## Availability Check
