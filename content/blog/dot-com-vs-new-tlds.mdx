## The .com Debate Is Alive and Well

Every few years, someone declares ".com is dead." And every few years, the data says otherwise. In 2026, .com still commands over 45% of all registered domains. But new TLDs are growing fast, and the question isn't whether .com matters — it's whether it matters *for you*.

## The Case for .com

### Trust and Credibility
Studies consistently show that consumers trust .com domains more than alternatives. In a 2024 survey, 68% of respondents said they'd trust a .com business more than an identical business on a new TLD.

### Type-In Traffic
Millions of people still type ".com" by reflex. If your site is on a different extension, some percentage of your potential visitors will end up at the .com version instead — which might belong to someone else.

### Email Credibility
Emails from .com addresses have higher open rates and lower spam filtering rates than emails from unusual TLDs. For B2B companies that rely on cold email, this matters.

### Resale Value
.com domains hold and appreciate in value better than any other extension. If your business fails, the domain itself might retain significant value.

## The Case for New TLDs

### Availability
The best .com names were registered decades ago. New TLDs offer access to short, clean, memorable names that are impossible to get in .com without paying five or six figures.

### Industry Signaling
Extensions like .ai, .io, and .dev instantly communicate your industry. A .ai domain tells visitors you're in the AI space before they even click.

### Cost
While premium .com domains sell for $5,000-500,000+, new TLDs offer great names for $10-100/year.

### Modern Perception
Tech-savvy audiences — developers, founders, investors — have fully accepted .io, .ai, and .co. In Silicon Valley, a .io domain is perfectly normal.

## What the Data Says

### SEO Impact
Google has confirmed that TLD choice does not directly affect search rankings. A .xyz site can rank just as well as a .com for the same content and backlink profile.

However, .com domains tend to have higher click-through rates in search results due to trust, which may indirectly boost rankings through user behavior signals.

### Conversion Rates
A/B tests have shown that .com landing pages convert 2-8% better than identical pages on new TLDs. The gap is shrinking but still measurable, especially for B2C businesses.

### Investor Perception
Many VCs still advise portfolio companies to acquire the .com. It signals seriousness and permanence. However, this bias is weakening as more successful companies launch on alternative TLDs.

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | .com Advantage | New TLD Advantage |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Consumer trust | ✅ Strong | ❌ Weaker |
| Availability | ❌ Scarce | ✅ Wide open |
| Cost | ❌ Expensive | ✅ Affordable |
| SEO | ➖ Neutral | ➖ Neutral |
| Tech audience trust | ➖ Neutral | ✅ Accepted |
| Email deliverability | ✅ Better | ❌ Variable |
| Type-in traffic | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

## The Hybrid Strategy

Many successful startups do both:

1. **Launch on a new TLD** (brand.io, brand.ai) to get started quickly and affordably
2. **Acquire the .com later** once you have revenue and traction, then redirect it
3. **Use the .com as the primary** domain once acquired

Notion launched on notion.so before acquiring notion.com. Figma used figma.com from the start. Both succeeded — the TLD was a minor factor compared to the product.

## Practical Advice

- **B2C business targeting mainstream consumers?** Get the .com. They expect it.
- **B2B SaaS targeting tech teams?** .io or .ai is perfectly fine.
- **Personal brand or portfolio?** .dev, .design, or .me all work.
- **E-commerce?** .com strongly preferred. Trust is everything in online shopping.
- **Budget under $100?** Use whatever TLD gets you the cleanest name.

## Check What's Available

Before deciding between .com and alternatives, see what's actually available for your brand name. Use [BrandScout](/) to check all major domain extensions plus social handles in one search — then make an informed decision.
