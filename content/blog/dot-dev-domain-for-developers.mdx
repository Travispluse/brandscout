# .dev Domains for Developers: The Extension Built for Code

If you're a developer building tools, libraries, or personal projects, the .dev extension was literally made for you. Launched by Google in 2019, .dev has become the natural home for developer-focused brands and projects.

## Why .dev Exists

Google acquired the .dev TLD and launched it specifically for developers and technology. Like .app, it requires HTTPS at the registry level, ensuring every .dev site is secure by default. Major companies quickly adopted it — web.dev (Google), opensource.dev, and github.dev.

## Who Uses .dev?

- **Developer tools and libraries** — Package managers, CLI tools, SDKs
- **Personal developer portfolios** — firstname.dev or handle.dev
- **Open-source projects** — Project documentation and landing pages
- **Developer-focused SaaS** — Products built for technical audiences
- **Tech blogs** — Developer content and tutorials

## Benefits of .dev

### Instant Context
A .dev domain tells visitors immediately that this is a developer resource. No confusion about the site's purpose.

### Mandatory HTTPS
Like .app, every .dev domain requires SSL. This is a security win and a minor SEO advantage.

### Strong Availability
Quality .dev domains are still widely available. Short names, dictionary words, and brandable terms that are long gone in .com are available in .dev.

### Professional Signaling
For job seekers and freelancers, a .dev domain for your portfolio signals technical competence. It's a subtle but effective differentiator.

### Affordable Pricing
Standard .dev domains cost $12-16/year, making them one of the cheapest quality extensions available.

## .dev for Personal Branding

A personal .dev domain is increasingly becoming a developer's digital business card:

- **firstname.dev** or **firstnamelastname.dev** for your portfolio
- Host your resume, projects, blog, and contact information
- Link it in your GitHub profile, LinkedIn, and conference talks
- Much more memorable than a GitHub Pages URL

## .dev vs Other Developer Extensions

### .dev vs .io
Both are popular in tech. .io is broader (any tech startup), while .dev is specifically for developer-oriented projects. .dev is cheaper ($12-16 vs $30-60).

### .dev vs .codes
.codes is longer and less recognized. .dev wins on brevity and brand recognition.

### .dev vs .engineering
Way too long. .dev is three characters; .engineering is eleven.

### .dev vs github.io
GitHub Pages is free but locked to GitHub's infrastructure. A .dev domain gives you control over hosting, DNS, and branding.

## Setting Up Your .dev Site

### Popular Hosting Options
- **Vercel** — Deploy Next.js, React, or static sites
- **Netlify** — JAMstack hosting with easy DNS configuration
- **GitHub Pages** — Free hosting with custom domain support
- **Cloudflare Pages** — Fast, free hosting with edge network

### Essential Steps
1. Register your .dev domain (Cloudflare, Namecheap, Google, etc.)
2. Get an SSL certificate (required — Let's Encrypt is free)
3. Configure DNS records pointing to your hosting
4. Deploy your site
5. Set up email forwarding if needed

## Creative .dev Domain Ideas

- **yourname.dev** — Personal portfolio
- **api.dev** — API documentation
- **learn.dev** — Developer education
- **build.dev** — Build tools and CI/CD
- **stack.dev** — Technology stack references
