The answer is obvious. Custom domain email tells clients, partners, and vendors that you're a legitimate business. It's one of the easiest ways to look professional.

## Email Hosting Options

### Google Workspace (Formerly G Suite)

**Cost:** $7/user/month (Business Starter)
**Storage:** 30GB per user
**Features:** Gmail interface, Google Drive, Calendar, Meet, Docs

Google Workspace is the most popular choice for small businesses. The Gmail interface is familiar, spam filtering is excellent, and integration with Google's productivity tools is seamless.

### Microsoft 365

**Cost:** $6/user/month (Business Basic)
**Storage:** 50GB mailbox, 1TB OneDrive
**Features:** Outlook, Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint

If your business uses Microsoft products, this is the natural choice. Outlook's email management features are powerful for high-volume email users.

### Zoho Mail

**Cost:** Free for up to 5 users (limited), $1/user/month (paid)
**Storage:** 5GB (free), 10GB+ (paid)
**Features:** Clean interface, calendar, tasks

Zoho Mail is the budget-friendly option. The free tier works for solo entrepreneurs who just need a professional email address.

### Fastmail

Fastmail is popular with privacy-conscious users. No ads, no tracking, and reliable performance.

### Your Web Host

Many hosting providers include email hosting. It's usually basic but functional for small brands. Check if your host offers it before paying for a separate service.

## Setting Up Custom Domain Email

### Step 1: Choose Your Provider

Select based on your budget, team size, and tool preferences.

### Step 2: Add Your Domain

In your email provider's admin panel, add your domain (yourbrand.com) and verify ownership.

### Step 3: Configure DNS Records

Add these records at your domain registrar or DNS provider:

- **MX records** — Tell email servers where to deliver mail
- **SPF record** (TXT) — Authorizes your email provider to send on your behalf
- **DKIM record** (TXT) — Adds a digital signature to verify authenticity
- **DMARC record** (TXT) — Tells receiving servers how to handle failed authentication

Your provider gives you the exact records to add.

### Step 4: Create Email Addresses

Set up addresses for your needs:
- hello@yourbrand.com (general inquiries)
- support@yourbrand.com (customer service)
- your-name@yourbrand.com (personal)

### Step 5: Test

Send test emails to and from your new address. Check that emails aren't landing in spam.

## Email Authentication Explained

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

A DNS record that lists which servers can send email for your domain. Without SPF, your emails may be flagged as spam.

### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

Adds a cryptographic signature to your emails. Receiving servers verify the signature to confirm the email wasn't tampered with.

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)

Tells receiving servers what to do when SPF or DKIM checks fail — report, quarantine, or reject. Start with a "none" policy and gradually increase to "reject."

## Email Best Practices for Brands

- **Use your custom domain for all business communication** — Even internal emails
- **Set up email signatures** with your brand name, title, and contact info
- **Don't use noreply@** for customer-facing emails — It's unfriendly
- **Archive, don't delete** — You may need email records for legal or tax purposes
- **Enable 2FA** on all email accounts

## Common Email Setup Mistakes

- **Forgetting SPF/DKIM/DMARC** — Your emails land in spam
- **Using too many email addresses** — Monitor every address you create
- **Not setting up forwarding** — info@, sales@, support@ should all reach someone
- **Skipping the test** — Always send test emails before using your address publicly
