## Why Email for a Brand Launch?

Social media algorithms decide who sees your content. Email goes directly to inboxes. You own the relationship. For brand launches, email delivers:
- **$36 average return for every $1 spent** (highest ROI of any channel)
- Direct access to interested people
- Full control over timing and messaging
- Measurable results from day one

## Building Your Pre-Launch Email List

### Start Before You Launch
Begin collecting emails four to eight weeks before launch. You want an audience ready to buy on day one.

### Lead Magnet Ideas for New Brands
Offer something valuable in exchange for an email address:
- Early access to the product or service
- Launch-day discount (10-20%)
- Free guide or resource related to your industry
- Behind-the-scenes access to the creation process
- Entry into a launch giveaway

### Where to Collect Emails
- **Landing page:** Create a simple "coming soon" page with email signup
- **Social media:** Link to your landing page in bios and posts
- **In person:** Collect emails at events, pop-ups, or networking
- **Referral program:** Give existing signups a unique link — reward them for bringing friends

### Realistic List Size Goals
For most new brands, 200-500 pre-launch subscribers is a solid foundation. Don't buy lists. Ever. Purchased lists have terrible engagement and can get your sending domain blacklisted.

## Email Platform Selection

Choose a platform that scales with you:
- **Free tier starters:** Mailchimp (free up to 500), MailerLite (free up to 1,000)
- **Growing brands:** ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign, Klaviyo
- **Enterprise:** HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud

For a brand launch, any platform with automation and segmentation will work.

## Your Launch Email Sequence

### Email 1: Welcome (Immediately After Signup)
- Thank them for subscribing
- Deliver the promised lead magnet
- Briefly introduce your brand and why it exists
- Set expectations for email frequency

### Email 2: The Story (Day 2-3)
- Share your brand's origin story
- Be personal and authentic
- Help them understand why you built this

### Email 3: The Problem (Day 5-6)
- Describe the problem you're solving
- Use specific examples and pain points
- Make them feel understood

### Email 4: The Solution Preview (Day 8-9)
- Tease the product or service
- Share sneak peeks, prototypes, or demos
- Build anticipation for launch day

### Email 5: Launch Announcement (Launch Day)
- The product is live — here's how to get it
- Honor any early-access discounts
- Include clear call-to-action
- Create urgency (limited quantities, time-limited discount)

### Email 6: Follow-Up (Day After Launch)
- Thank early adopters
- Share launch day results ("100 people signed up in the first 24 hours!")
- Address any common questions
- Remind about expiring launch offers

## Post-Launch Email Strategy

### Ongoing Sequences to Build
- **Welcome sequence** for new subscribers (5-7 emails over 2 weeks)
- **Onboarding sequence** for new customers
- **Re-engagement sequence** for inactive subscribers
- **Monthly newsletter** with value-driven content

### Email Content Mix
Follow the 80/20 rule:
- 80% valuable content (tips, insights, stories, education)
- 20% promotional content (products, offers, announcements)

### Subject Line Best Practices
- Keep them under 50 characters
- Use personalization when authentic
- Create curiosity without being clickbait
- Test different approaches and track open rates
- Avoid spam trigger words (free, guarantee, act now)

## Metrics to Track

- **Open rate:** Average 20-25% is healthy. Below 15% signals a problem.
- **Click-through rate:** Average 2-5% is good.
- **Unsubscribe rate:** Under 0.5% per send is normal. Spikes indicate content or frequency problems.
- **Conversion rate:** Track how many email recipients become customers.
- **List growth rate:** Net new subscribers minus unsubscribes.

## Technical Setup for Deliverability

Ensure your emails actually reach inboxes:
- Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records on your domain
- Use a professional sending domain (hello@yourbrand.com, not yourbrand@gmail.com)
- Warm up your sending domain gradually (don't send 10,000 emails on day one)
- Clean your list regularly — remove bounces and inactive subscribers

## Your Email Address Is Your Brand

Your email domain is a brand touchpoint. hello@yourbrand.com builds trust. yourbrand123@gmail.com doesn't. Secure your domain first, then set up professional email.
