## Why Your Etsy Shop Name Deserves Careful Thought

On Etsy, your shop name competes with millions of others. It appears in search results, on your banner, and in every customer receipt. A thoughtful name builds trust and helps buyers remember you when they want to reorder.

## Etsy's Naming Rules

Before you brainstorm, know the constraints:

- **4 to 20 characters** with no spaces or special characters
- **Letters and numbers only**
- **Must be unique** across all Etsy shops
- **You can change it once** — after that, you need to contact support

These rules push you toward compact, creative names. Embrace the limitation.

## Strategies That Work on Etsy

### Reflect Your Craft

Etsy buyers are looking for handmade, vintage, or unique items. Names that hint at craftsmanship perform well:

- StitchAndStone
- WildclayStudio
- KnotAndThread

These immediately tell buyers what kind of shop they're visiting.

### Use Your Name Plus a Descriptor

Many successful Etsy sellers build a personal brand. "EmmaKnits" or "LunaBeadworks" feels approachable and authentic — exactly what Etsy shoppers want.

### Go Whimsical

Etsy's culture rewards personality. Playful names like "OhSoCozy" or "TinyRiotGoods" stand out in search results and stick in memory.

## Keyword Considerations for Etsy SEO

Etsy's search algorithm considers your shop name as a ranking factor, though it's less important than tags and titles. If you can naturally include a keyword — like "prints," "jewelry," or "pottery" — it helps. But don't sacrifice brandability for a keyword.

**Good:** WillowPottery (keyword + brand)
**Bad:** CheapHandmadePottery (sounds spammy)

## Testing Your Etsy Name

Since you have limited ability to change your name later, test thoroughly:

1. **Type it without spaces.** Is it still readable? "TherapistFinder" famously demonstrates how no-space names can go wrong.
2. **Search Etsy for similar names.** You don't want to be confused with an established shop.
3. **Check outside Etsy too.** If you grow beyond Etsy, you'll want a matching domain and social handles.

Run your top choices through [BrandScout](/) to verify domain and social media availability before you finalize your Etsy name.

## What to Do When Your Name Is Taken

Etsy's character limit and no-spaces rule mean many obvious names are gone. Try:

- **Add "Co," "Made," or "Goods"** — ThreadcraftGoods, MadeByLuna
- **Use your location** — BrooklynBeadCo, PNWPottery
- **Swap synonyms** — If "Bloom" is taken, try "Sprout" or "Petal"

## Names That Scale Beyond Etsy

Many Etsy sellers eventually launch their own website. Choose a name that works everywhere:

- Avoid Etsy-specific terms in your name
- Pick something you'd be proud to put on packaging
- Make sure the .com domain is available or affordable

## Examples of Great Etsy Shop Names

- **ModParty** — Short, fun, signals party supplies
- **BurrowAndBee** — Nature imagery, feels handmade
- **InkMeThis** — Playful, memorable, works for prints or stationery

## Your Action Plan

1. List ten words related to your craft, style, and personality
2. Combine them into five to eight name candidates (remember: no spaces, 4-20 characters)
3. Check Etsy availability
4. Check domain and social availability with [BrandScout](/)
5. Pick the one that feels right when you say it out loud

Your Etsy shop name is the foundation of your brand. Take an afternoon, do it right, and you won't have to worry about rebranding later. Start checking availability now with [BrandScout](/).
