## Fashion Names Carry Weight

In no other industry does a name carry as much status as in fashion. "Chanel" on a bag transforms canvas into luxury. Your fashion brand name will appear on labels, shopping bags, storefronts, and Instagram posts. It needs to work everywhere.

## Understand Your Market Position

Before naming, define where you sit:

- **Luxury:** Names should feel exclusive and timeless (Hermès, Givenchy, Balenciaga)
- **Contemporary:** Modern, approachable, design-forward (Everlane, Reformation, Aritzia)
- **Streetwear:** Bold, cultural, attitude-driven (Supreme, Off-White, BAPE)
- **Sustainable:** Names that suggest values and transparency (Patagonia, Allbirds, Pangaia)
- **Fast fashion:** Accessible, trend-forward, easy to remember (Zara, H&M, Shein)

Your name should match your tier. A luxury brand named "ChicCheap" sends the wrong message.

## Fashion Naming Approaches

### Designer Names

The most traditional approach. Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Stella McCartney. This works when the designer's identity is the brand. First name, last name, or both — the key is euphony (how it sounds).

### Invented Words

Adidas (Adi Dassler), Nike (Greek goddess), Prada (founder's surname that happened to sound exotic). Invented or repurposed words give you a blank canvas to build meaning.

### Evocative Names

Anthropologie evokes exploration. Free People suggests liberation. These names create a lifestyle image that extends beyond clothing.

### Acronyms

DKNY, COS, H&M, ASOS. These work when the full name is too long or when the letters themselves become iconic.

## Testing Fashion Brand Names

Fashion is visceral. Test accordingly:

### The Label Test
Mock up your name on a clothing label. Does it look like something you'd find in the right stores?

### The Instagram Test
Create a mock Instagram profile with your name. Does the handle look good? Does it fit in a bio?

### The Word-of-Mouth Test
"I just bought this amazing jacket from [name]." Does it sound natural?

### The Global Test
If you'll sell internationally, verify the name works across cultures. "Nova" means "doesn't go" in Spanish — not ideal for a brand.

## Domain and Social Strategy for Fashion

Fashion brands live on Instagram, TikTok, and increasingly on their own DTC websites. You need:

1. **Exact match .com domain** — or at minimum .co
2. **Instagram handle** — non-negotiable for fashion
3. **TikTok username** — where fashion discovery happens now
4. **Pinterest** — major referral source for fashion e-commerce

## Trademark Considerations in Fashion

Fashion trademark conflicts are common and expensive. Before investing in branding:

- Search USPTO for your name in clothing and accessories classes
- Check EUIPO if you'll sell in Europe
- Search for unregistered brands using the name — even without a trademark, they may have common law rights
- Consult a fashion IP attorney before your first production run

## Building Name Recognition

A great name is just the start. Build recognition through:

- **Consistent visual identity** — Logo, typography, color palette
- **Signature elements** — Think Burberry's plaid or Louis Vuitton's monogram
- **Brand story** — Why does this brand exist? What does it stand for?
- **Community** — Fashion brands with loyal communities outlast trends

## Common Fashion Naming Mistakes

- **Too many words** — Keep it to one or two words maximum
- **Unpronounceable** — If influencers can't say it in videos, you lose free marketing
- **Too similar to existing brands** — Legal risks aside, you'll always live in their shadow
- **Trendy spelling** — "Klothes" or "Phashion" looks amateur
