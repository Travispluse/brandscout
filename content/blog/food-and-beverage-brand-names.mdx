## Your Name Should Be as Good as Your Product

In food and beverage, your brand name appears on packaging, menus, delivery apps, and grocery shelves. It needs to work at every size — from a tiny ingredient label to a billboard. And it needs to make people hungry, thirsty, or curious.

## Naming by Category

### Packaged Food

Shelf appeal is everything. Your name competes with dozens of others in the same aisle:
- **Simple and bold:** Kind, Rxbar, Epic
- **Descriptive:** Bare Snacks, Smart Sweets, Caulipower
- **Playful:** Pirate's Booty, Hippeas, LesserEvil

### Beverages

Drink names need to sound refreshing and be easy to order:
- **Crisp and clean:** Liquid Death, Olipop, Spindrift
- **Energetic:** Celsius, Bang, Reign
- **Sophisticated:** Fever-Tree, St-Germain, Hendrick's

### CPG Brands

Consumer packaged goods names should be:
- Easy to read at arm's length on a shelf
- Distinguishable from competitors
- Memorable enough to add to a shopping list

### Restaurant/Café Brands

These names set the atmosphere:
- Sweetgreen (fresh, healthy)
- Shake Shack (fun, indulgent)
- Blue Bottle Coffee (artisan, premium)

## Naming Strategies for Food Brands

### Ingredient-Forward

Put your hero ingredient in the name:
- Chobani (derived from the Turkish word for shepherd — tied to dairy)
- Siete (family-centered, but the brand focuses on specific ingredients)
- Oatly (it's oat milk — the name tells you everything)

### Founder Story

Personal names add authenticity in food:
- Newman's Own
- Annie's Homegrown
- Dave's Killer Bread

### Sensory Words

Names that trigger taste, texture, or aroma:
- Crunch, Snap, Sizzle
- Smooth, Velvet, Silk
- Zest, Tang, Spice

### Attitude and Personality

Brands with attitude stand out in crowded categories:
- Liquid Death (just water, but the name is unforgettable)
- Ugly Drinks (embracing imperfection)
- OffLimits (cereal brand breaking rules)

## Packaging and Label Considerations

Your name must work visually on packaging:

- **Short names** have more design flexibility and larger typography
- **All-caps names** read well on bottles and cans
- **Names with distinct letter shapes** are more readable at small sizes

Mock up your name on packaging before finalizing. Does it look appetizing?

## Regulatory Naming Rules

The FDA has specific rules about food labeling:

- Your brand name cannot misrepresent the product
- Terms like "organic," "natural," and "healthy" have legal definitions
- Allergen-related terms in names can create labeling complications
- "Made in [Country]" claims must be accurate

Consult an FDA labeling attorney if your name makes any implicit claims.

## Digital Presence for Food Brands

Modern food brands need:

1. **Website** — For direct-to-consumer sales and brand storytelling
2. **Instagram** — Food photography drives brand awareness
3. **Amazon** — Many CPG brands sell here
4. **Delivery apps** — Your name appears in search results on DoorDash, Instacart, etc.

## Common Food Brand Naming Mistakes

- **Too generic:** "Natural Foods Co." blends in with everything
- **Unappetizing associations:** Test your name for unintended meanings
- **Too long for packaging:** If it doesn't fit on a label, it's too long
- **Ignoring pronunciation:** If customers can't order it confidently, they'll order something else
