## Free Tools for Every Stage of Naming

Brand naming involves multiple stages: brainstorming, screening, validation, and registration. Different tools serve different stages. Here's a curated list of the best free options.

## Name Generation Tools

### Namelix
**What it does:** Uses AI to generate short, brandable business names based on keywords and style preferences.

**Best for:** Getting unstuck when brainstorming stalls. The AI generates hundreds of options with logo mockups.

**Limitations:** Many generated names will have taken domains. Quality varies — treat it as a starting point, not a final answer.

### Wordoid
**What it does:** Creates invented words that look and sound like real words. You can specify language roots, length, and starting/ending letters.

**Best for:** Creating coined names that are pronounceable and ownable.

**Limitations:** Doesn't check availability. You'll need to validate results separately.

### Lean Domain Search
**What it does:** Combines your keyword with other words and instantly checks .com availability.

**Best for:** Finding available .com domains quickly when your first choice is taken.

**Limitations:** Only checks .com. Combinations can feel forced.

### ChatGPT / AI Assistants
**What it does:** Generate name ideas through conversational prompting. Describe your brand, audience, and values — get dozens of creative suggestions.

**Best for:** Exploring creative directions and getting unexpected combinations. You can iterate and refine in real time.

**Limitations:** AI doesn't check availability. Names may already be trademarked or in use.

## Domain Availability Tools

### Instant Domain Search
**What it does:** Shows domain availability in real time as you type. Covers .com and many alternative TLDs.

**Best for:** Rapid-fire domain checking during brainstorming sessions.

### Domainr
**What it does:** Searches across all TLDs for creative domain hacks (like del.icio.us or bit.ly).

**Best for:** Finding alternative domain structures when the .com is taken.

### WHOIS Lookup (whois.domaintools.com)
**What it does:** Shows who owns a domain, when it was registered, and when it expires.

**Best for:** Determining if a taken domain might be available for purchase (parked domains, expired registrations).

## Trademark Screening Tools

### USPTO TESS
**What it does:** Searches the US Patent and Trademark Office database for registered and pending trademarks.

**Best for:** Preliminary trademark screening before investing in a name.

**How to use:** Search for your brand name using the "Basic Word Mark Search." Review results for identical or confusingly similar marks in your product/service category.

### WIPO Global Brand Database
**What it does:** Searches international trademark registrations across 70+ trademark offices.

**Best for:** International trademark screening if you plan to operate beyond the US.

### Trademarkia
**What it does:** User-friendly trademark search interface with filing status tracking.

**Best for:** Easier navigation than the raw USPTO database. Includes trademark monitoring features.

## Social Handle Checking Tools

### Namechk
**What it does:** Checks username availability across dozens of social networks and domains simultaneously.

**Best for:** Verifying that your brand name is available as a consistent handle across all major platforms.

### KnowEm
**What it does:** Similar to Namechk but covers 500+ social networks and websites.

**Best for:** Comprehensive cross-platform handle checking.

## Linguistic and Research Tools

### Google Translate
**What it does:** Translates your brand name into 100+ languages.

**Best for:** Quick screening for unintended foreign language meanings. Not a substitute for native speaker review, but catches obvious problems.

### Urban Dictionary
**What it does:** Crowdsourced dictionary of slang and informal language.

**Best for:** Checking if your brand name has any slang meanings you're not aware of.

### Google Trends
**What it does:** Shows search interest for terms over time and across regions.

**Best for:** Checking if your brand name is already associated with something else in search. Also useful for comparing name candidates.

### AnswerThePublic
**What it does:** Shows what questions people ask about any topic.

**Best for:** Understanding the search landscape around your brand category for content planning.

## All-in-One Tools

### BrandScout
**What it does:** Checks brand name availability across domains, social media handles, and trademarks in a single search.

**Best for:** Eliminating the need to check multiple individual tools. Get a comprehensive availability report instantly.

**Why it's different:** Instead of checking domains on one site, social handles on another, and trademarks on a third, BrandScout consolidates everything into one search.
