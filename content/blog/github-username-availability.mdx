# GitHub Username Availability: How to Secure the Perfect Developer Handle

Your GitHub username is your developer identity. It appears in every repository URL, every commit, and every pull request. For developers and tech companies, getting the right GitHub handle is as important as getting the right domain name.

## Why Your GitHub Username Matters

### Professional Identity
Recruiters and hiring managers look at GitHub profiles. Your username is the first thing they see — "jsmith92847" signals less professionalism than "janesmith" or "jsmithdev."

### Repository URLs
Every repo you create lives at github.com/yourusername/reponame. A clean username makes your project URLs more shareable and professional.

### Package Publishing
If you publish npm packages, your GitHub username often becomes your package namespace. A messy username means messy package names.

### Open Source Credibility
Active open-source contributors build recognition around their GitHub handle. Consistency between your GitHub username and other professional identities strengthens your brand.

## How to Check Availability

### Direct URL Check
Navigate to github.com/desiredusername. If you see a 404 page, the name might be available (or it could be a deleted account with a restricted name). If you see a profile, it's taken.

### GitHub API
Use the GitHub API to check programmatically: `GET https://api.github.com/users/desiredusername`. A 404 response means potentially available.

### BrandScout
For a broader check that includes GitHub alongside other platforms, use [BrandScout](/) to see availability across domains and social media simultaneously.

## What to Do When Your Name Is Taken

### Check If the Account Is Active
If the account has no repos, no activity, and no followers, it might be an abandoned account.

### GitHub Name Reclamation
GitHub allows name reclamation for accounts that have no activity and are clearly abandoned. Submit a request through GitHub Support. This works best when the account has no repositories, no commits, and no recent activity. There's no guarantee, but it's worth trying.

### Variations That Work
- Add "dev" or "hq" suffix: "janesmithdev" or "acmehq"
- Use your full name: "janemariesmith"
- Add your focus area: "janesmith-ai"
- Use initials: "jmsmith"

### Variations to Avoid
- Random numbers: "janesmith12345"
- Underscores (GitHub allows hyphens, not underscores)
- Extremely long names that are hard to type
- Names that differ significantly from your brand

## GitHub Organization Usernames

For companies, GitHub Organizations provide a team namespace. The same availability rules apply, but organization names can be more brand-focused:

- Claim your brand name as an organization early
- Use the organization for official repos, the personal account for individual work
- Organization names appear in all team repository URLs

## Username Best Practices

### Keep It Short
Shorter usernames are easier to type, remember, and fit in URLs. Aim for under 15 characters.

### Match Your Other Handles
Consistency across GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, and your domain strengthens your personal brand. If you're "janedev" everywhere, people can find you easily.

### Think Long-Term
Your GitHub username will follow you for years, possibly decades. Choose something that works for your current and future career.

### Avoid Trends
Don't include current employer names, trendy tech terms, or anything that might feel dated in five years.

## Securing Your Developer Brand

Your GitHub username is one piece of a larger developer identity. The best approach is checking availability across all platforms at once before committing to a name.

Try [BrandScout](/) to check your desired username across GitHub, domains, and other platforms simultaneously. Find a name that's consistently available and build a cohesive developer brand.
