## The Stories Behind the Names

Every brand name has an origin story. Some are strategic masterstrokes. Others are happy accidents. Here are 20 fascinating naming origins that reveal what makes a brand name stick.

## Tech Giants

### Google
Larry Page and Sergey Brin originally called their search engine "BackRub." Thankfully, they renamed it after "googol" — the number 1 followed by 100 zeros — to represent the massive amount of information they wanted to organize. The misspelling was accidental but stuck.

### Apple
Steve Jobs was on a fruitarian diet and had just returned from an apple farm. He thought Apple sounded "fun, spirited, and not intimidating." It also put them before Atari alphabetically in the phone book.

### Amazon
Jeff Bezos wanted a name starting with "A" to appear first in directories. He chose Amazon because it was the largest river in the world, representing his ambition to build the largest store.

### Nike
Named after the Greek goddess of victory. Co-founder Jeff Johnson suggested it the night before the deadline. Phil Knight didn't love it initially but went with it because they needed to submit paperwork.

### Spotify
Co-founder Daniel Ek was brainstorming with Martin Lorentzon when one of them misheard a suggested name. They later reverse-engineered an explanation: "spot" + "identify."

## Consumer Brands

### Adidas
Named after founder Adolf "Adi" Dassler — Adi + Das. His brother Rudolf founded a rival shoe company called Puma.

### IKEA
An acronym of founder Ingvar Kamprad's initials (I.K.) plus the first letters of the farm (Elmtaryd) and village (Agunnaryd) where he grew up.

### Starbucks
Named after Starbuck, the first mate in Herman Melville's *Moby-Dick*. The founders wanted a name that evoked the romance of the sea and seafaring tradition of early coffee traders.

### Lego
From the Danish phrase "leg godt," meaning "play well." The founders later discovered it also means "I put together" in Latin — a happy coincidence.

### Pepsi
Named after pepsin, the digestive enzyme. Creator Caleb Bradham originally called it "Brad's Drink" before rebranding.

## Modern Brands

### Uber
German for "above" or "over," suggesting superiority. Co-founder Travis Kalanick originally wanted "UberCab" but shortened it after a cease-and-desist from San Francisco regulators.

### Slack
An acronym for "Searchable Log of All Communication and Knowledge." Conveniently, the word also means ease and comfort.

### Zoom
Founder Eric Yuan wanted something simple that conveyed speed. "Zoom" was short, energetic, and universally understood.

### Stripe
The founders chose it because of the stripe on credit cards. Simple, visual, and directly connected to payments.

### Airbnb
Short for "Air Bed and Breakfast" — the founders rented out air mattresses in their apartment to conference attendees who couldn't find hotel rooms.

## Legacy Brands

### Mercedes-Benz
Emil Jellinek, an early Daimler car dealer, named the cars after his daughter Mercedes. Benz came from Karl Benz, co-inventor of the automobile.

### Coca-Cola
Named after two key ingredients: coca leaves and kola nuts. The "K" in kola was changed to "C" for visual consistency.

### Sony
From "sonus" (Latin for sound) and "sonny" (a term for bright young men in postwar Japan). It was chosen because it worked across languages.

### Canon
Originally "Kwanon," named after the Buddhist goddess of mercy. Simplified to Canon for international appeal.

### Häagen-Dazs
Reuben Mattus invented the name to sound Danish-European, evoking old-world craftsmanship. It's completely made up and means nothing in any language.

## Patterns and Lessons

Looking across these stories, several patterns emerge:

1. **Simplicity wins.** Almost all these names are under three syllables.
2. **Meaning is optional.** Google, Sony, and Häagen-Dazs had no meaning at launch. Meaning was built through brand experience.
3. **Personal connections work.** Adidas, IKEA, and Mercedes all have personal origins that became universal.
4. **First choices often fail.** BackRub → Google. Brad's Drink → Pepsi. UberCab → Uber. Don't get attached to your first idea.
5. **Availability matters.** Many of these names required iteration specifically because earlier choices were taken.

## Write Your Own Origin Story

The best brand names feel inevitable in hindsight, but they're rarely obvious upfront. Start with strategy, explore creatively, and — critically — make sure your chosen name is available everywhere it needs to be.
