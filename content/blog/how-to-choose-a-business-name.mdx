## Why Your Business Name Matters More Than You Think

Your business name is your first impression. It appears on every invoice, every social profile, every ad, and every conversation about your brand. A strong name builds trust instantly. A weak one creates friction before you even get started.

The good news: choosing a great name doesn't require creative genius. It requires a systematic approach.

## Step 1: Define Your Brand Positioning

Before brainstorming names, answer these questions:

- **Who is your target customer?** A B2B SaaS company and a children's toy brand need very different vibes.
- **What's your brand personality?** Professional, playful, luxurious, approachable?
- **What's your unique value?** Speed, quality, affordability, innovation?

Write down 5-10 adjectives that describe your ideal brand. These become your naming filters.

## Step 2: Brainstorm Without Judgment

Set a timer for 30 minutes and generate as many name ideas as possible. Use these techniques:

### Word Combination
Combine two relevant words: Face + Book = Facebook. Sales + Force = Salesforce.

### Foreign Words
Look up your core concept in Latin, Greek, Japanese, or other languages. Volvo comes from Latin for "I roll."

### Invented Words
Create something entirely new. Google, Kodak, and Xerox were all made-up words that became household names.

### Acronyms
HBO, IBM, BMW — but be careful. Acronyms only work once you're already famous.

### Name Modifications
Take a real word and modify the spelling: Lyft, Tumblr, Flickr.

Aim for at least 30-50 candidates before filtering.

## Step 3: Apply Your Filters

Now ruthlessly cut your list using these criteria:

- **Easy to spell.** If you have to spell it out on the phone, it's too complicated.
- **Easy to pronounce.** Can someone say it after reading it once?
- **Memorable.** Does it stick in your mind or blend in with everything else?
- **Short enough.** Two to three syllables is the sweet spot.
- **No negative connotations.** Check multiple languages and slang dictionaries.

You should be down to 5-10 strong candidates.

## Step 4: Check Availability Everywhere

This is where most founders waste hours. You need to check:

- **Domain availability** (.com is still king)
- **Social media handles** across all major platforms
- **Trademark databases** (USPTO, WIPO)
- **State business registries**

Checking each one manually takes forever. Use [BrandScout](/) to check domain, social media, and trademark availability for all your candidates in seconds.

## Step 5: Test With Real People

Don't just ask friends and family — they'll tell you what you want to hear. Instead:

- **The phone test:** Say the name over the phone. Can people spell it correctly?
- **The bar test:** If you told someone your company name at a noisy bar, would they remember it the next day?
- **The Google test:** Search the name. What comes up? Is the space crowded?
- **The logo test:** Can you visualize the name working as a logo?

## Step 6: Sleep on It

Don't decide in one session. Write your top 3 names on a sticky note and look at them for a week. You'll naturally gravitate toward one.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Being too literal.** "Best Quality Plumbing" tells you nothing memorable.
- **Following trends.** Names ending in "-ly" or "-ify" already feel dated.
- **Ignoring the domain.** If the .com isn't available, strongly reconsider.
- **Choosing by committee.** Too many opinions lead to bland compromises.

## Your Next Step

The naming process should take days, not months. Start with your positioning, brainstorm freely, filter ruthlessly, and verify availability early.
