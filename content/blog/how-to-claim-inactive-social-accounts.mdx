## Millions of Usernames Are Wasted

An estimated 30-40% of social media accounts are inactive. Many haven't posted in years. They're holding desirable usernames hostage — and their owners have likely forgotten they exist.

Getting these usernames released isn't easy, but it's possible. Here's how to approach each major platform.

## X (Twitter): Best Chance of Success

Twitter has the most established process for releasing inactive usernames.

### Twitter's Inactive Account Policy
Twitter considers accounts inactive if they haven't logged in for at least 12 months. They periodically purge inactive accounts and release usernames.

### How to Request
1. Go to Twitter's Help Center
2. File a report under "Inactive or Squatted Usernames"
3. Provide your desired username and explain why you need it
4. Include trademark documentation if you have it

### Tips
- Having a registered trademark dramatically increases your chances
- Be patient — Twitter processes these in waves, not individually
- Check back periodically; accounts may be purged during mass cleanup events

## Instagram: Hardest Platform

Instagram rarely releases inactive accounts, and there's no official "claim" process for inactive handles.

### What Works
- **Trademark report:** If you own a trademark matching the username, file an IP report through Meta's Help Center. This is the most reliable method.
- **Impersonation report:** If the account is using your brand's identity, file an impersonation report.
- **Direct contact:** Try DMing the account or finding the owner through other platforms.

### What Doesn't Work
- Simply reporting an account as inactive — Instagram doesn't consider inactivity alone as grounds for removal
- Repeatedly filing reports — this can get your own account flagged

### Meta's Account Recovery
Meta has stated they may reclaim usernames from accounts that are inactive for extended periods, but they haven't published specific criteria or timelines.

## TikTok: Moderate Difficulty

### What Works
- **Trademark claims:** File through TikTok's IP report form
- **Username change requests:** TikTok support can sometimes help if you explain the situation
- **Waiting:** TikTok occasionally releases inactive accounts, especially those that never posted

### Process
1. Visit TikTok's support page
2. Submit a trademark or impersonation report
3. Include your trademark registration details
4. Follow up if you don't hear back within 2 weeks

## LinkedIn: Company Pages

### Company Page URLs
LinkedIn allows you to request a custom URL for your company page. If someone else has your desired URL, you may be able to claim it if:
- Your company has a registered trademark
- The existing page is clearly abandoned
- You can demonstrate legitimate claim to the name

### Process
Contact LinkedIn support directly with your trademark documentation.

## YouTube: Handles

YouTube handles (@username) are relatively new, so availability is generally better than other platforms. If your handle is taken:

1. Check if the account is active (has it uploaded recently?)
2. If inactive, report it through YouTube's trademark complaint form
3. YouTube may release handles from accounts that violate their terms

## General Strategy Across All Platforms

### Step 1: Document Everything
Before reaching out to any platform:
- Screenshot the inactive account
- Note the last post date
- Record any evidence of squatting or impersonation
- Gather your trademark registration if you have one

### Step 2: Try Direct Contact First
Before escalating to the platform, try reaching the account holder:
- Send a DM if possible
- Search the username on other platforms for contact info
- Check if their email is findable through Google

### Step 3: File Official Requests
Use each platform's formal processes:
- Trademark complaints (strongest)
- Impersonation reports (if applicable)
- Inactive account reports (weakest but worth trying)

### Step 4: Be Patient
Platform responses take 1-8 weeks. Follow up once after 2 weeks, then wait. Aggressive follow-ups don't help.

### Step 5: Have a Backup Plan
While pursuing inactive accounts, prepare a fallback username that works across all platforms. You might get your preferred handle eventually, but have a consistent alternative ready.

## The Nuclear Option: Register a Trademark

If you're serious about claiming a username, register a trademark for your brand name. It costs $250-350 per class and takes 8-12 months. Once granted, it's your strongest tool for claiming usernames on any platform.

## Avoid the Problem Entirely

The easiest approach: choose a brand name that's available everywhere from the start. Use [BrandScout](/) to check all major social platforms, domains, and trademarks in one search — and pick a name where claiming inactive accounts isn't necessary.
