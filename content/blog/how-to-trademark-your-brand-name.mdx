## Why Trademark Your Brand Name?

A trademark gives you the exclusive legal right to use your brand name in your product or service category. Without one, anyone can use the same name — and you have limited legal recourse.

Trademark registration provides:
- Legal presumption of ownership
- The right to sue for infringement in federal court
- The ability to use the ® symbol
- Protection against domain squatters (UDRP process)
- Leverage to remove social media impersonators
- The ability to record with US Customs to prevent counterfeit imports

## Before You File: Pre-Filing Checklist

### 1. Conduct a Trademark Search
Search the USPTO's Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) for existing marks that are identical or confusingly similar to yours. Look for:
- Exact matches in your product/service category
- Similar-sounding names (phonetic equivalents)
- Similar names in related categories

### 2. Determine Your Mark Type
- **Standard Character Mark:** Protects the words regardless of font, style, or design
- **Design Mark:** Protects a specific logo or stylized version
- **Sound/Motion Marks:** Less common, for audio or animated logos

For most businesses, start with a Standard Character Mark — it provides the broadest protection.

### 3. Identify Your Goods/Services Class
Trademarks are registered within specific classes (categories). The USPTO uses the Nice Classification system with 45 classes. Common examples:
- Class 9: Software, apps, electronics
- Class 25: Clothing
- Class 35: Advertising, business management
- Class 41: Education, entertainment
- Class 42: Computer and software services

You can register in multiple classes, but each costs a separate filing fee.

## The Filing Process

### Step 1: Create a USPTO Account
Go to trademark.uspto.gov and create an account. You'll need this for filing and tracking your application.

### Step 2: Choose Your Filing Basis
- **Use in Commerce (Section 1a):** You're already using the mark in business. You'll need to provide a "specimen" (example of the mark in use).
- **Intent to Use (Section 1b):** You plan to use the mark but haven't started yet. Costs more overall but reserves the name.

### Step 3: Complete the Application
Through the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS), provide:
- Your name and address (or your business entity info)
- The mark (your brand name)
- The class(es) of goods/services
- A description of your goods/services
- A specimen showing the mark in use (if filing under 1a)
- The filing fee

### Step 4: Pay the Filing Fee
- **TEAS Plus:** $250 per class (requires selecting from pre-approved descriptions)
- **TEAS Standard:** $350 per class (allows custom descriptions)

### Step 5: Wait for Examination
A USPTO examining attorney reviews your application. Timeline: 3-4 months from filing.

### Step 6: Respond to Office Actions (If Any)
The examiner may issue an Office Action requesting clarification, changes, or additional evidence. You have 3 months to respond (extendable to 6 months).

Common Office Actions:
- Likelihood of confusion with an existing mark
- Descriptiveness (the name describes the goods too directly)
- Specimen issues (your evidence of use doesn't qualify)

### Step 7: Publication Period
If approved, your mark is published in the Official Gazette for 30 days. This gives existing trademark holders a chance to oppose your registration.

### Step 8: Registration
If no one opposes (or you win any opposition), your trademark registers. For Intent to Use applications, you must first file a Statement of Use with evidence that you're using the mark.

## Total Timeline and Cost

- **Timeline:** 8-12 months if everything goes smoothly; 12-18 months if Office Actions are issued
- **Cost (DIY):** $250-350 per class filing fee
- **Cost (with attorney):** $1,000-2,500 total including legal fees
- **Renewal:** Every 10 years ($300 per class)

## Common Mistakes

- **Not searching first:** Filing without a thorough search wastes your filing fee if a conflicting mark exists
- **Wrong class:** Filing in the wrong class leaves you unprotected in your actual market
- **Too descriptive:** Marks that merely describe your product (e.g., "Fast Delivery" for a shipping company) are weak and may be refused
- **Not using the mark:** You must actively use the trademark in commerce. Unused trademarks can be cancelled.

## Do You Need a Lawyer?

You can file without one, but an attorney helps when:
- Your search reveals potential conflicts
- You're unsure which classes to file in
- You receive an Office Action
- Your business operates in multiple countries

For straightforward applications, many founders file successfully on their own.

## Start With Availability

Before spending $250+ on a trademark filing, make sure your brand name is actually available. Use [BrandScout](/) to check trademark databases, domains, and social handles — so you know your name is clear before investing in legal protection.
