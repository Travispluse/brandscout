## Can New Brands Do Influencer Marketing?

Yes — but not the way most people imagine. You're not hiring Kim Kardashian. You're building relationships with micro and nano-influencers who genuinely care about your niche. This approach is more effective and vastly more affordable.

## Understanding Influencer Tiers

### Nano-Influencers (1K-10K followers)
- Highest engagement rates (4-8%)
- Most authentic relationships with followers
- Often willing to work for free product
- Best for: new brands with limited budgets

### Micro-Influencers (10K-100K followers)
- Strong engagement (2-4%)
- Niche expertise and loyal audiences
- Affordable ($100-1,000 per post)
- Best for: brands building credibility in a specific niche

### Mid-Tier Influencers (100K-500K followers)
- Moderate engagement (1-3%)
- Broader reach but less personal connection
- $1,000-10,000 per post
- Best for: brands ready to scale awareness

### Macro and Mega Influencers (500K+)
- Lower engagement rates (0.5-2%)
- Massive reach
- $10,000-1,000,000+ per post
- Best for: established brands with large budgets

For new brands, nano and micro-influencers deliver the best ROI. Period.

## Finding the Right Influencers

### Look in Your Existing Community
Your first influencer partners might already follow you. Check your followers, email subscribers, and early customers. Someone who genuinely loves your product will be more convincing than someone paid to pretend.

### Search Strategically
- Browse relevant hashtags on Instagram and TikTok
- Search YouTube for content related to your niche
- Check competitor accounts to see who tags them
- Use influencer discovery tools (Upfluence, Heepsy, or even manual searching)

### Evaluate Fit, Not Just Numbers

Before reaching out, assess:
- **Audience alignment:** Do their followers match your target customer?
- **Content quality:** Would you be proud to have your brand featured in their content?
- **Engagement authenticity:** Are comments genuine or bot-generated?
- **Brand safety:** Any controversial content that could reflect poorly on you?
- **Previous partnerships:** Do they promote too many brands? (Credibility dilution)

## Structuring the Partnership

### Compensation Models
- **Free product:** Send product in exchange for an honest review. Best for nano-influencers.
- **Flat fee:** Pay per post, story, or video. Clear expectations for both sides.
- **Affiliate commission:** Pay a percentage of sales they generate. Low risk for you, performance-based for them.
- **Hybrid:** Product + flat fee + commission. Often the most motivating structure.

### What to Include in Your Brief
- Brand overview and key messages
- Product highlights and talking points
- Required elements (tags, hashtags, links, disclosure)
- Creative freedom parameters (what they can and can't say)
- Posting timeline
- Usage rights for the content

### What NOT to Do
- Don't script every word. Audiences spot inauthentic content instantly.
- Don't require only positive comments. Honest reviews build more trust.
- Don't ignore FTC disclosure requirements. "#ad" or "#sponsored" is legally required.

## Outreach Template

Keep initial outreach short and personal:

*"Hey [Name], I've been following your content about [topic] and really appreciate [specific thing]. We just launched [Brand Name] — [one sentence about what it is]. I'd love to send you one to try. No obligations — if you like it, maybe share your honest thoughts with your audience. Interested?"*

Personal, low-pressure, and respectful of their time.

## Measuring Influencer Marketing Results

### Track These Metrics
- **Reach:** How many people saw the content
- **Engagement:** Likes, comments, shares, saves
- **Traffic:** Website visits from influencer content (use UTM links)
- **Conversions:** Sales or signups attributed to the campaign
- **Cost per acquisition:** Total spend divided by conversions
- **Content quality:** Reusable assets for your own channels

### Set Realistic Expectations
A single influencer post rarely transforms a business. Influencer marketing works through consistent, repeated exposure across multiple partners. Plan for a minimum of 10-15 partnerships before evaluating the channel's effectiveness.

## Building Long-Term Relationships

The best influencer partnerships aren't one-offs. They're ongoing relationships:
- Send products consistently, not just at launch
- Share their content on your channels
- Invite them to provide input on new products
- Feature them in your brand's content
- Pay fairly and promptly

A handful of genuine brand advocates outperform fifty one-time sponsored posts.

## Your Brand Name Matters to Influencers

Influencers evaluate your brand before agreeing to partner. A professional brand name with a clean website, consistent social handles, and available domain signals legitimacy.

Make sure your brand name is secured across all platforms with [BrandScout](/) before reaching out to influencer partners.
