## Your Instagram Handle Is Your Storefront

With over 2 billion monthly active users, Instagram is often the first place people look for your brand. Your username determines whether they find you — or find a competitor instead.

## How Instagram Usernames Work

- Maximum 30 characters
- Only letters, numbers, periods, and underscores allowed
- Case-insensitive (@BrandName and @brandname are the same)
- Must be unique across all Instagram accounts
- Also reserves your handle on Threads automatically

## Tip 1: Match Your Brand Name Exactly

The best Instagram handle is your brand name, period. No modifiers, no abbreviations, no creative spelling. If your brand is Acme, your handle should be @acme.

When your handle matches your brand, people can find you by instinct. They don't need to search — they just type @brandname and you appear.

## Tip 2: Keep It Under 15 Characters

Instagram allows 30 characters, but shorter handles perform better:
- Easier to type on mobile keyboards
- More visible in comments and mentions
- Less likely to be misspelled
- Consistent with Twitter's 15-character limit

If your brand name is longer than 15 characters, consider whether a shorter brand name might serve you better overall.

## Tip 3: Avoid Periods and Underscores

While Instagram allows these characters, they create friction:
- People forget them when searching for you
- They look cluttered in @mentions
- They're easy to miss on small screens
- They break the visual flow of your handle

Use them only if absolutely necessary (e.g., your exact brand name is taken and @brandname.co is the only option).

## Tip 4: Use Your Display Name for Keywords

Your username should be your brand name. Your display name is where you add context:

- Username: @freshbake
- Display name: "FreshBake | Artisan Bakery & Café"

The display name is searchable on Instagram, so including relevant keywords (bakery, café, your city) helps people discover you through search.

## Tip 5: Claim Your Handle Before Announcing

The moment you decide on a brand name — before announcing it publicly, before printing business cards, before telling anyone — register the Instagram handle. It takes 30 seconds and prevents someone from sniping it.

## Tip 6: Check Handle Availability First

Don't fall in love with a brand name only to discover the Instagram handle is taken. Check availability across all platforms *before* committing to any name.

## Tip 7: If Your Ideal Handle Is Taken

In order of preference:
1. **Contact the owner** — politely ask if they'd release it
2. **File a trademark claim** — if you own the trademark
3. **Use a consistent modifier** — @getbrandname or @brandnamehq
4. **Reconsider the brand name** — if it's taken on multiple platforms

Whatever modifier you choose, use the same one on every platform.

## Tip 8: Optimize Your Profile for Search

Instagram's search algorithm considers:
- Your username
- Your display name
- Your bio
- Your content

Make sure your bio includes your location, industry, and primary service/product. This helps you appear in relevant searches even if someone isn't searching your brand name specifically.

## Tip 9: Don't Change Your Handle

Once you've established an Instagram presence, changing your handle breaks:
- Direct links shared in other contexts
- @mentions in existing posts and comments
- Bookmarked profile links
- User memory and search habits

Choose right the first time. If you must change, announce it prominently and update all external links.

## Tip 10: Secure Related Handles

If your handle is @brandname, consider also registering:
- @brandname.co (common variation)
- @brandnameco (without period)

This prevents impersonators and captures people searching for variations.

## Start With a Full Availability Check

Instagram is just one platform. Your brand name needs to work across domains, social media, and trademarks. Use [BrandScout](/) to check everything at once — and find a handle that's perfect on Instagram and everywhere else.
