## The Foundation of Everything

This entire checklist assumes you have the right brand name. A name that's available as a domain, claimable across social platforms, and clear of trademark conflicts. If you're not sure about your name yet, that's step zero.

Validate your brand name across every platform with [BrandScout](/) before working through this checklist.
