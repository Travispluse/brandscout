## Every State Has Different Rules

Forming an LLC requires registering a name with your state — and every state has its own requirements. While the basics are similar, the details vary enough to trip up founders who don't check their state's specific rules.

## Universal LLC Naming Rules

Despite state-by-state differences, these rules apply virtually everywhere:

### Required Designators
Your LLC name must include a designator indicating it's an LLC:
- "LLC" or "L.L.C."
- "Limited Liability Company"
- Some states also allow "Ltd." or "Limited Company"

### Uniqueness
Your LLC name must be distinguishable from other business entities registered in the same state. "Distinguishable" doesn't just mean different — most states require meaningful distinction.

### No Misleading Terms
You can't use words that imply your LLC is a different type of entity:
- "Corporation," "Corp," or "Inc." (implies a corporation)
- "Bank," "Insurance," or "Trust" (implies a regulated financial institution — these require special licensing)

## State-Specific Variations

### Restricted Words
Most states restrict words that imply government affiliation or regulated industries:
- **All states:** "Bank," "Insurance," "Trust" typically require approval
- **Some states:** "University," "Attorney," "Doctor" require proof of licensure
- **California:** Restricted words include "bank," "trust," "trustee," and "insurer"
- **New York:** "board," "council," "authority" are restricted
- **Texas:** "lottery" and "veterans" require approval

### Name Reservation
Most states allow you to reserve an LLC name before filing your Articles of Organization:
- **Duration:** Typically 60-120 days
- **Cost:** $10-50 in most states
- **Purpose:** Locks in the name while you prepare your filing

### Doing Business As (DBA)
If you want to operate under a name different from your legal LLC name, most states require a DBA (also called a fictitious name, trade name, or assumed name) registration.

## How to Check LLC Name Availability

### Step 1: Search Your State's Business Registry
Every state has an online business entity search tool. Common locations:
- Secretary of State website
- Division of Corporations
- Business Registry Office

### Step 2: Search Broadly
Don't just search your exact name. Check for:
- Similar spellings
- Singular vs. plural forms
- With and without common words (The, Inc., Group)

### Step 3: Check Across States
If you plan to operate in multiple states (as a "foreign LLC"), check name availability in each state. Your name might be available in your home state but taken in others.

## LLC Name vs Brand Name vs Domain

These are three different things:

- **LLC name:** Legal entity name registered with the state. Must follow state rules.
- **Brand name (DBA):** The name you market under. Can be different from LLC name.
- **Domain name:** Your web address. Independent of both.

### Example
- LLC name: Fresh Bake Holdings LLC
- Brand name (DBA): FreshBake
- Domain: freshbake.com
- Social handles: @freshbake

Many founders register a generic LLC name and operate publicly under a DBA that matches their brand and domain.

| California | $70 | $800+ | $10 |

## Steps to Register Your LLC Name

1. Choose your brand name
2. Check availability in your formation state
3. Check trademark availability (separate from state registration)
4. Reserve the name if your state allows it
5. File Articles of Organization
6. Register DBA if your brand name differs from LLC name
7. Register domain and social handles

## Start With Brand Availability

Before diving into state filings, make sure your brand name works everywhere — not just your state registry. Use [BrandScout](/) to check domains, social handles, and trademarks alongside your chosen name. A name that's available at the state level but trademarked federally will still cause problems.
