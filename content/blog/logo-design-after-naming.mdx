## The Expensive Mistake Most Founders Make

Founders get excited. They jump on Fiverr, commission a logo, and start slapping it on everything — before they've even finalized their brand name. Then the name changes, and the logo no longer works.

This isn't a theoretical risk. It happens constantly. The fix is simple: finalize your name first.

## Why Name Comes Before Logo

### Your Name Dictates Visual Direction

The word "Bolt" demands different visual treatment than "Meadow." Short, punchy names work with bold sans-serif type and geometric icons. Longer, flowing names call for lighter typefaces and organic shapes.

If you design a logo without a name, you're designing in a vacuum.

### Wordmarks Are Often the Best Logos

Many of the world's most recognizable brands use wordmark logos — stylized versions of their name with no separate icon. Google, Coca-Cola, FedEx, and Disney are all essentially just their names, rendered beautifully.

You can't create a wordmark without a finalized name.

### Name Length Affects Layout

A two-letter name like "GE" works as a square mark. A name like "Anthropic" needs horizontal space. Your logo's aspect ratio, scalability, and placement options all depend on what the name actually looks like written out.

## How Your Name Should Inform Logo Design

### Sound and Feeling

Say your brand name out loud. Does it feel sharp or soft? Fast or slow? The sonic quality should influence the visual design. "Crisp" demands clean lines. "Velvet" invites curves and softness.

### Letterforms and Opportunities

Look at the letters in your name. Do any create opportunities for visual play? FedEx hides an arrow between the E and x. Amazon's smile connects A to Z. The best logos find meaning already hiding in the name.

### Industry Context

Your name within your industry creates certain expectations. A tech company called "Forge" might feature metallic textures and industrial type. A spa called "Forge" would need warmer, more unexpected treatment to subvert the name's hardness.

## The Right Process

### 1. Finalize the Brand Name
Complete all research — domain availability, trademark checks, social handle availability, linguistic screening. Don't design anything until the name is locked.

### 2. Define Brand Strategy
Document your positioning, personality, values, and target audience. This brief guides the designer.

### 3. Explore Typography First
Before drawing icons, experiment with typefaces. How does the name look in serif vs. sans-serif? All caps vs. title case vs. lowercase? Often the right typeface treatment IS the logo.

### 4. Consider If You Need an Icon
Not every brand needs a separate icon or symbol. Wordmarks are clean, memorable, and adaptable. Add an icon only if it genuinely enhances recognition or communicates something the name can't.

### 5. Test at Multiple Sizes
Your logo must work as a tiny favicon, a social media profile picture, a website header, and a billboard. Test each size before finalizing.

## Working With Designers

### What to Include in Your Brief
- Finalized brand name
- Brand positioning and personality traits
- Target audience description
- Competitor logos to differentiate from
- Color preferences (or let the designer propose)
- Required applications (digital, print, signage)

### What NOT to Do
- Don't provide a sketch of what you want. You'll anchor the designer on a mediocre idea.
- Don't ask for dozens of concepts. Three to five focused directions beats twenty scattered ones.
- Don't design by committee. One decision-maker approves or rejects.

## Budget Expectations

- **AI logo generators:** $0-50. Fine for validation-stage startups. Replace as soon as you can afford to.
- **Freelance designer:** $500-5,000. Good for most small businesses.
- **Branding agency:** $5,000-100,000+. Appropriate when brand identity is a core competitive advantage.

Whatever your budget, spending it after naming is settled is infinitely more efficient than spending it before.

## Start With the Name

Everything in branding flows from the name. Get it right, and every subsequent decision — logo, colors, voice, website — becomes clearer and easier.
