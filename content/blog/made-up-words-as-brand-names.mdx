## Why Invented Names Dominate

Some of the most recognizable brands in history are completely made up. Google, Xerox, Kodak, Häagen-Dazs, Spotify — none of these were real words before they became brands. And that's precisely their strength.

Invented names are infinitely ownable. No one else can claim them. They have no baggage, no competing definitions, and they're almost always available as domains and social handles.

## Types of Invented Brand Names

Not all made-up names are created equal. Here are the most common approaches:

### Neologisms
Entirely new words with no etymological root. Kodak's founder George Eastman wanted a word starting and ending with K — a letter he considered strong and incisive. He shuffled letters until Kodak emerged.

### Portmanteaus
Two real words blended into one. Pinterest (pin + interest), Instagram (instant + telegram), Microsoft (microcomputer + software). These carry built-in meaning while still being unique.

### Modified Spellings
Real words with altered spelling: Lyft (lift), Tumblr (tumbler), Flickr (flicker). This technique provides semantic grounding while creating trademarkable distinctiveness.

### Classical Roots
Words constructed from Latin or Greek roots: Verizon (veritas + horizon), Accenture (accent + future). These sound authoritative and professional.

### Phonesthetic Coinages
Words designed purely for how they sound: Zynga, Zillow, Zara. The Z-sound conveys energy and modernity.

## How to Invent Your Own Brand Name

### Step 1: Define Your Sound Profile
Decide what your name should *feel* like. Write down 3-5 adjectives (bold, smooth, techy, warm) and identify consonant and vowel patterns that match.

### Step 2: Create Raw Material
- List keywords related to your brand
- Break them into syllables and fragments
- Combine fragments in unexpected ways
- Try adding or removing letters from real words
- Experiment with suffixes: -io, -ly, -ify, -ara, -ova

### Step 3: Apply Phonetic Rules
Your invented word needs to be pronounceable. Follow these guidelines:

- **Alternate consonants and vowels.** CVCCVC patterns (like "Spotify") are naturally pronounceable.
- **Use familiar letter combinations.** "Th," "sh," "str" are easy. "Xgh" is not.
- **Keep it under 4 syllables.** Three is ideal for most brands.
- **Avoid ambiguous pronunciation.** If people could say it two different ways, it'll cause confusion.

### Step 4: The Stress Test
Before falling in love with your invented name:

- Can someone spell it after hearing it once?
- Does it sound like anything offensive in other languages?
- Is it too similar to an existing brand?
- Does it look good written down?

## The Risks of Made-Up Names

Invented names aren't without downsides:

- **No inherent meaning.** You'll spend more on marketing to build associations from scratch.
- **Pronunciation challenges.** If people can't say it, they won't talk about it.
- **Perception of trying too hard.** Some invented names feel gimmicky rather than genuine.
- **SEO cold start.** There's no search volume for a word that doesn't exist yet.

## When Invented Names Work Best

- **Tech companies** building new categories (Google defined "search")
- **Global brands** needing a name that works across languages
- **Crowded markets** where every real word is taken
- **Trademark-sensitive industries** where legal protection is critical

## When to Avoid Them

- **Local service businesses** where descriptive clarity builds trust
- **B2B companies** where prospects need to immediately understand what you do
- **Low-budget startups** that can't afford the marketing investment to build name recognition

## Famous Made-Up Name Origins

- **Google:** A misspelling of "googol" (10^100)
- **Skype:** Originally "Sky-Peer-to-Peer," shortened to Skyper, then Skype
- **Spotify:** Misheard word during a brainstorm, later reverse-engineered as "spot" + "identify"
- **Häagen-Dazs:** Completely fabricated to sound Danish-European. It means nothing.

## Validate Before You Commit

The beauty of invented names is they're usually available everywhere. But "usually" isn't "always." Check your invented name's availability across domains, social platforms, and trademark databases before you invest in branding.

Use [BrandScout](/) to verify your invented name is truly unclaimed — across domains, social handles, and trademarks — in one search.
