## The Power of a Unified Brand Identity

When someone sees your brand, they should be able to find you anywhere. If your website is acme.com, they should be able to type @acme on any social platform and find you. This alignment isn't just convenient — it's a competitive advantage.

## Why Matching Matters

### Reduced Friction
Every mismatch between your domain and social handles adds a micro-friction point. Users who know your website can't guess your social profiles. Users who find you on TikTok can't guess your website. Each friction point costs you visitors and followers.

### Brand Recall
One name is easier to remember than multiple variations. When everything matches, customers only need to remember one word — not "the website is X, but Instagram is Y, and Twitter is Z."

### Trust Signals
Matching handles signal professionalism and legitimacy. Mismatched handles can suggest the brand is unofficial, new, or even fraudulent.

### Word-of-Mouth Efficiency
When customers recommend your brand, they can say "check out BrandName" — and that single mention works for your website, Instagram, Twitter, and everywhere else. No qualifiers needed.

### SEO Reinforcement
When your brand name is consistent across all platforms, it strengthens your branded search results. Google connects your social profiles to your website more reliably.

## How to Achieve a Match

### Start With the Username Check
Before registering a domain, check if the matching username is available on all major social platforms. This is the most common place where matching breaks down.

### If the Domain Is Available but Social Handles Aren't
Options:
1. Choose a different brand name that's available everywhere
2. Contact the social handle owners to acquire the names
3. Use a consistent modifier across ALL channels (domain included)

Example: If @acme is taken everywhere, don't use acme.com + @acmehq on social. Instead, use acmehq.com + @acmehq everywhere. Consistency beats having a "clean" domain with messy handles.

### If Social Handles Are Available but the Domain Isn't
Options:
1. Try alternative TLDs: brandname.io, brandname.co, brandname.ai
2. Add a modifier to the domain: getbrandname.com, trybrandname.com
3. Purchase the domain from the current owner

### The Priority Order
When you can't match everything perfectly, prioritize in this order:
1. Social media handles (harder to change, multiple platforms)
2. Domain name (can use alternative TLDs)
3. Business legal name (can use DBA)

## Real-World Examples

### Perfect Matches
- stripe.com → @stripe (everywhere)
- notion.so → @notionhq (everywhere)
- figma.com → @figma (everywhere)

### Imperfect but Consistent
- canva.com → @canva (everywhere, even though Canva didn't initially own canva.com)
- linear.app → @linear (everywhere)

### Problematic Mismatches
- A company with different handles on every platform and a domain that doesn't match any of them — this is surprisingly common and always costs the brand.

## The Matching Checklist

Before finalizing your brand name, verify:

- [ ] Domain (.com or appropriate TLD) available
- [ ] Instagram handle available
- [ ] Twitter/X handle available
- [ ] TikTok handle available
- [ ] LinkedIn company URL available
- [ ] YouTube handle available
- [ ] Facebook page URL available
- [ ] All of the above match exactly or use the same consistent modifier

## Make It Easy

Checking availability across 7+ platforms manually is tedious and error-prone. Use [BrandScout](/) to verify your brand name across all major platforms in a single search — and find the name that matches everywhere.
