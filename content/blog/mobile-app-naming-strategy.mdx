## App Names Are Discovery Tools

In the App Store and Google Play, your name is a primary ranking factor. Users search for solutions, and if your name contains relevant keywords or is memorable enough to be searched directly, you win downloads.

## The Two-Part App Name Strategy

Most app stores give you two fields:

1. **App Name** (30 characters on iOS): Your brand name
2. **Subtitle** (30 characters on iOS) or **Short Description** (80 characters on Google Play): Your keyword opportunity

This means your brand name doesn't need to be descriptive. Let the subtitle do the keyword work. "Calm" is the brand. "Sleep, Meditation & Relaxation" is the subtitle.

## Naming Approaches That Work

### Short and Punchy

The most downloaded apps tend to have short names: Uber, Lyft, Snap, Cash. One or two syllables, easy to say, easy to tap.

### Descriptive but Brandable

"Headspace" describes what the app gives you (mental space) while being a real brand. "Duolingo" hints at "duo" and "lingo" — two languages. These names educate and brand simultaneously.

### The Mashup

Combine syllables from relevant words. "Instagram" merged "instant" and "telegram." "Pinterest" merged "pin" and "interest." This approach creates unique, trademarkable names.

## App Store Optimization (ASO) and Your Name

Your app name is weighted heavily in App Store search algorithms. Here's how to optimize:

- **Front-load your brand name** — "Mint: Budget & Finance Tracker" not "Budget Finance Tracker - Mint"
- **Include one primary keyword in your subtitle** — but keep it natural
- **Don't keyword-stuff** — Apple and Google penalize this
- **Localize your subtitle** for different markets, but keep the brand name consistent

## Checking Availability in App Stores

Unlike domains, app store names aren't strictly unique — multiple apps can share a name. But you want to avoid confusion. Before committing:

1. Search both App Store and Google Play for your name
2. Check if any existing app with that name has significant downloads
3. Verify the matching domain is available
4. Secure social media handles

Check domain and social availability instantly with [BrandScout](/).

## Common App Naming Mistakes

### Making It Too Long

"The Ultimate Daily Workout and Fitness Tracker Pro" is not a name. It's a sentence. Keep your brand name under 15 characters if possible.

### Using Generic Terms Alone

"Weather" or "Calculator" as standalone names only work if you're Apple. Everyone else needs distinctiveness. "Weather" becomes "Carrot Weather" — memorable and differentiated.

### Ignoring Trademark Conflicts

App stores will let you publish under a trademarked name. But the trademark owner can file a takedown. Always search trademarks before launch.

### Forgetting the Icon Connection

Your name and icon work together. A name like "Flamingo" paired with a flamingo icon creates instant recognition. Consider how your name translates visually.

## Testing Your App Name

### A/B Test With Ad Campaigns

Before launch, run Facebook or Google ads pointing to a landing page. Test two or three name variations and measure click-through rates.

### Ask for Recall

Tell ten people your app name. Wait 24 hours. Ask them what it was. The names they remember are the ones worth keeping.

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**iOS:** Name (30 chars) + Subtitle (30 chars). Apple reviews subtitles and rejects spammy ones.

**Google Play:** App name (30 chars) + Short description (80 chars). Google allows slightly more keyword flexibility.

**Both:** Updates to your name may temporarily affect rankings. Don't change names frequently.

## Launch Checklist

1. Finalize brand name (under 15 characters ideal)
2. Draft subtitle/short description with primary keyword
3. Register matching .com domain
4. Claim social media handles
5. File trademark application
6. Create app store developer accounts
7. Submit your app with optimized metadata

Use [BrandScout](/) to handle steps 2-4 in one search. A great app name combined with smart ASO is the foundation of organic growth.
