## The Risk Is Real

The Chevy Nova reportedly struggled in Spanish-speaking markets because "no va" means "doesn't go." While this particular story is debated, the underlying risk is genuine. Brand names routinely cause problems across languages.

Real examples:
- **Pinto** (Ford) — Slang for small male genitalia in Brazilian Portuguese
- **Siri** (Apple) — Means "buttocks" in Japanese slang
- **Lume** (deodorant) — Means "light" in several Romance languages (good) but can evoke "slum" in British English
- **Calpis** (Japanese drink) — Sounds too close to "cow piss" in English, rebranded as "Calpico" for Western markets

## When to Care About Multilingual Screening

### You Should Screen If:
- You sell or plan to sell internationally
- Your domestic market includes significant non-English-speaking populations
- Your brand operates online (the internet is global by default)
- You plan to expand within five years

### You Can Skip If:
- You're a hyperlocal business serving one community
- You have zero plans for any international presence
- Your name is a common English word with well-established positive meaning globally

Even then, a quick screen takes minutes and prevents years of regret.

## How to Screen Names Across Languages

### Step 1: Identify Your Priority Languages
List the languages spoken in your current and planned markets. At minimum, screen for: Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Arabic, Portuguese, Hindi, and Korean.

### Step 2: Check Direct Translations
Use Google Translate and native speakers to check if your brand name is an existing word in each language. Look for negative, vulgar, or inappropriate meanings.

### Step 3: Check Phonetic Similarities
A name might not translate directly but might sound like something problematic. Say the name aloud to native speakers of each language and ask what it sounds like to them.

### Step 4: Check Cultural Connotations
Some words are fine linguistically but carry cultural baggage. Numbers, colors, and animals have different connotations across cultures. The number 4 is unlucky in Chinese culture. White flowers symbolize death in many Asian countries.

### Step 5: Check Existing Trademarks
Your name might be available in English-speaking trademark registries but already trademarked in your target international markets. Check WIPO's Global Brand Database for international trademark conflicts.

## Strategies for Multilingual Names

### Use Invented Words
Made-up words have no pre-existing meaning in any language — though you still need phonetic screening. "Kodak" was chosen partly because it had no meaning in any known language.

### Use Universal Sounds
Stick to sounds that exist across most languages: M, N, P, B, T, K, and basic vowels. Avoid sounds that are language-specific, like the English "th" (difficult for many non-native speakers).

### Choose Visually Simple Names
Names that use only the Latin alphabet's most common letters travel better visually. Avoid letters with diacritical marks or characters that don't exist in your target markets' alphabets.

### Consider Transliteration
How will your name be written in non-Latin scripts (Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, Korean)? Some names transliterate beautifully — Coca-Cola in Chinese (可口可乐) means "delicious happiness." Work with native speakers to find the best transliteration.

## The Localization Decision

When expanding internationally, you face three choices:

### Keep the Same Name Globally
**Pros:** Consistent global identity. Simpler brand management.
**Cons:** Pronunciation and meaning issues in some markets.
**Best for:** Names that are short, invented, and phonetically neutral.

### Adapt the Name for Each Market
**Pros:** Perfect linguistic fit in every market.
**Cons:** Fragmented brand identity. Complex to manage.
**Best for:** Brands where local trust matters more than global consistency.

### Create a Global Name From Scratch
**Pros:** Designed to work everywhere from day one.
**Cons:** Constrains naming options significantly.
**Best for:** Companies that know they'll be global from launch.

## Quick Screening Checklist

Before finalizing any brand name:

- [ ] Checked meaning in top ten world languages
- [ ] Verified phonetic similarity to inappropriate words
- [ ] Confirmed cultural connotation safety
- [ ] Tested transliteration in non-Latin scripts
- [ ] Checked international trademark databases
- [ ] Had native speakers evaluate the name

## Protect Your Name Globally

A name that works in every language is rare and valuable. Once you find one, secure it across international domains and social platforms.
