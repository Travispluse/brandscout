## Music Brands Are Built on Identity

In music, your brand name carries cultural weight. It appears on album art, concert posters, streaming platforms, and merchandise. A great music brand name becomes part of the culture itself.

## Types of Music Brands

### Record Labels

Labels are curators. Their names signal a genre and aesthetic:
- **Hip-hop:** Def Jam, Top Dawg, Dreamville
- **Electronic:** Warp, Ninja Tune, Monstercat
- **Indie:** Sub Pop, 4AD, Matador
- **Major:** Names are often founder-based or abstract (Columbia, Atlantic, Universal)

### Recording Studios

Studio names suggest sonic quality and creative energy:
- Abbey Road, Electric Lady, Sound City
- Geographic or evocative names work well

### Artist/Band Names

While technically different from business branding, artist names follow similar principles:
- Memorable and unique
- Searchable on streaming platforms
- Available as social handles

### Music Tech Companies

Software and hardware brands:
- Ableton, Native Instruments, Splice
- These lean toward tech naming conventions

## Naming Strategies for Music Brands

### Sonic and Musical References

Draw from music terminology:
- Tempo, Cadence, Resonance
- Octave, Harmony, Tremolo
- These work but are common — combine with unexpected words

### Cultural and Geographic

Tie your brand to a place or cultural moment:
- Motown (Motor Town — Detroit)
- Nashville Sound (genre and city)
- Stone Throw (Los Angeles hip-hop label)

### Abstract and Evocative

Names that create a mood without being literal:
- Ghostly International (atmospheric, mysterious)
- Secretly Canadian (quirky, unexpected)
- Jagjaguwar (invented, distinctive)

### Founder Names

Personal names or combined names:
- Def Jam (Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin's creation)
- Brainfeeder (Flying Lotus's label — personality-driven)

## Platform Considerations

Music brands exist across many platforms:

1. **Streaming:** Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal — your label or brand name appears on every release
2. **Social media:** Instagram, TikTok, YouTube — essential for promotion
3. **Website:** For press kits, tour dates, and merchandise
4. **Bandcamp:** For independent releases

Consistency across all platforms is crucial. A name that's available everywhere prevents confusion and strengthens your brand.

## Trademark Considerations in Music

The music industry has extensive trademark history:

- Band names and label names can be trademarked
- Similar names in the same genre can lead to legal disputes
- International touring means international trademark considerations
- Merch and licensing require trademark protection

Search existing labels and artists before committing to a name. A conflict discovered after you've printed merch is expensive.

## The Live Test

Music brands appear in live contexts:

- **Concert posters:** Does the name look good in large format?
- **Festival lineups:** Does it stand out in a list of names?
- **DJ drops and announcements:** Can an MC say it clearly?
- **Merchandise:** Does it work on a t-shirt?

## Digital Discovery

On streaming platforms, your label or brand name affects how people find your artists:

- Unique names are easier to search for
- Avoid names identical to popular songs or albums
- Your Spotify label page and Apple Music label page are discoverable

## Music Brand Naming Mistakes

- **Too niche for your ambitions:** A name tied to one genre limits you if you want to expand
- **Hard to spell:** Festival-goers searching for your label after a set need to find you
- **Already famous:** Using a well-known word means you'll compete for search visibility
- **Offensive without context:** Edgy names can work in music but consider all audiences
