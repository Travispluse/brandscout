## Industries Have Naming Cultures

Walk through a tech conference and you'll hear names like Lattice, Rippling, and Notion. Walk through a law firm directory and you'll see Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler. These patterns aren't accidental — they reflect industry expectations.

Understanding your industry's naming conventions helps you decide: follow the pattern for credibility, or break it for differentiation.

## Technology and SaaS

### Common Patterns
- Single abstract words: Slack, Zoom, Figma, Notion
- Action verbs: Canva, Grammarly, Calendly
- Compound words: Salesforce, HubSpot, Mailchimp
- Made-up words: Twilio, Airtable, Shopify

### What Works
Tech favors short, modern-sounding names that feel like products rather than companies. One or two syllables dominate. Names often become verbs ("Slack me," "Zoom call").

### What to Avoid
Overly corporate names (TechSolutions Inc.), names with "tech" in them (too generic), and names that describe the current product too narrowly (you'll pivot).

## Food and Beverage

### Common Patterns
- Founder names: Ben & Jerry's, Newman's Own, Dave's Killer Bread
- Place names: Arizona Tea, Brooklyn Brewery, Napa Valley Naturals
- Descriptive: Whole Foods, Five Guys, Sweetgreen
- Playful/Whimsical: Innocent (drinks), Graze, Oatly

### What Works
Food brands benefit from warmth, authenticity, and personality. Founder names and place names build trust. Playful names work for challenger brands disrupting traditional categories.

### What to Avoid
Names that sound clinical or corporate. People want food from humans, not institutions.

## Fashion and Luxury

### Common Patterns
- Founder surnames: Chanel, Gucci, Prada, Dior
- Short invented words: Zara, Uniqlo, Shein
- Evocative words: Anthropologie, Reformation, Allbirds

### What Works
Luxury brands lean heavily on founder names — it creates heritage and exclusivity. Fast fashion and DTC brands prefer short, memorable invented names. Sustainable fashion brands use evocative names that suggest values.

### What to Avoid
Names that sound cheap when you're trying to be premium. Names that try too hard to sound luxurious (excessive French or Italian without authentic connection).

## Finance and Fintech

### Common Patterns
- Traditional: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan (founder surnames)
- Modern fintech: Stripe, Plaid, Square, Brex
- Trust-signaling: Fidelity, Prudential, Vanguard

### What Works
Traditional finance uses founder names and trust-signaling words. Fintech deliberately breaks these conventions with short, approachable names that make finance feel accessible.

### What to Avoid
If you're a fintech, don't name yourself like a bank from 1850. If you're a bank, don't try to sound like a startup — it undermines trust.

## Healthcare and Wellness

### Common Patterns
- Clinical: Pfizer, Merck, AstraZeneca
- Wellness: Calm, Headspace, Hims, Hers
- Nature-inspired: Burt's Bees, Seventh Generation, Method

### What Works
Clinical companies use invented names that sound scientific. Consumer wellness brands use simple, warm, human words. The trend is toward accessibility and approachability.

## Professional Services

### Common Patterns
- Partner names: Deloitte, McKinsey, Accenture
- Descriptive: Boston Consulting Group
- Acronyms: PwC, EY, KPMG

### What Works
Founder/partner names dominate because they signal personal accountability and expertise. Acronyms work once firms are well-established.

## Real Estate

### Common Patterns
- Location + descriptor: Coastal Properties, Summit Realty
- Founder names: Keller Williams, Coldwell Banker
- Aspirational: Compass, Redfin, Zillow

### What Works
Traditional firms use founder names and locations for local trust. Tech-enabled real estate companies use modern, abstract names.

## How to Use These Patterns

1. **Study your competitors' names.** What patterns dominate?
2. **Decide: conform or contrast?** Both strategies can work.
3. **If conforming:** Follow the pattern but add a unique twist.
4. **If contrasting:** Break the pattern deliberately, not accidentally.

## The Universal Rule

Regardless of industry, every name needs to be available. Check your industry-appropriate name candidates for domain availability, social handles, and trademark conflicts using [BrandScout](/) — it takes seconds and prevents costly surprises.
