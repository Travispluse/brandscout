## Why Startup Naming Deserves Serious Attention

Your startup's name will appear on pitch decks, product screens, press releases, and hopefully term sheets. It's the first thing investors, customers, and partners learn about you. Getting it right from day one saves time, money, and brand equity.

## Phase 1: Strategic Groundwork

Before generating a single name idea, define your naming brief.

### Answer These Questions
- What does your startup do in one sentence?
- Who is your ideal customer? (Be specific: "Series A SaaS founders" not "businesses")
- What are 5 adjectives that describe your brand personality?
- What names do your competitors use? What patterns do you see?
- Will you expand internationally? Into adjacent markets?

### Choose a Naming Style
- **Descriptive:** Tells people what you do (Salesforce, YouTube)
- **Abstract:** Unique word with no literal meaning (Google, Zillow)
- **Evocative:** Suggests a quality or feeling (Amazon, Patagonia)
- **Founder-based:** Uses founder names (Bloomberg, Dell)
- **Acronym:** Letters standing for something (IBM, SAP)

For most startups, **evocative** or **abstract** names work best. They're distinctive, trademarkable, and flexible enough to grow with your business.

## Phase 2: Brainstorming

Dedicate at least two full sessions to brainstorming. Here's a structured approach:

### Session 1: Divergent Thinking (90 minutes)
- Mind-map your brand's core concepts
- Free-associate from your 5 brand adjectives
- Explore metaphors from nature, mythology, science, music
- Use a thesaurus aggressively
- Look up key concepts in Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Japanese
- Combine word fragments and syllables
- Goal: 100+ raw candidates

### Session 2: Convergent Thinking (60 minutes)
- Review your raw list with fresh eyes
- Group similar names into themes
- Star anything that creates an emotional reaction
- Combine elements from different candidates
- Goal: 15-20 strong candidates

### AI-Assisted Brainstorming
Use ChatGPT or Claude as a brainstorming partner. Give it your naming brief and ask for 50 suggestions in different styles. Cherry-pick the interesting fragments and directions, then iterate.

## Phase 3: Filtering

Run your 15-20 candidates through these filters:

### Non-Negotiable Criteria
- Can someone spell it after hearing it once?
- Can someone pronounce it after reading it once?
- Is it under 3 syllables (or 10 characters)?
- Does it avoid negative meanings in major languages?

### Strategic Criteria
- Does it align with your brand personality?
- Is it distinct from competitor names?
- Does it work as a verb? ("Just Google it" — not required, but powerful)
- Will it age well in 10 years?

You should have 5-7 finalists.

## Phase 4: Availability Validation

This is where most founders waste the most time — or make the most expensive mistakes.

For each finalist, check:
- **.com domain** (non-negotiable for most startups)
- **Social handles** (Instagram, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok)
- **USPTO trademark database** (in your product/service category)
- **App store listings** (if you're building an app)
- **State business registries** (for LLC/Corp registration)

Checking all of this manually for 5-7 names across 8+ platforms takes hours. [BrandScout](/) checks everything in one search — domains, social handles, and trademarks — so you can validate all your finalists in minutes.

## Phase 5: Testing

### Quantitative Testing
Use a survey tool to show your top 3 names to 50-100 people from your target demographic. Ask them to:
- Rate memorability (1-5)
- Guess what the company does
- Rate how premium/trustworthy it sounds (1-5)
- Choose their favorite

### Qualitative Testing
Have 5-10 one-on-one conversations. Say the name out loud and observe reactions. Ask: "What comes to mind?" First impressions are revealing.

## Phase 6: Registration and Protection

Once you've chosen your name:

1. **Register the domain immediately.** Don't wait.
2. **Claim social handles** on every platform, even ones you won't use yet.
3. **File a trademark application.** An attorney makes this easier but isn't strictly required.
4. **Register the business entity** (LLC, Corp) with your state.
5. **Document your naming rationale.** This helps with future brand guidelines and trademark defense.

## Timeline and Budget

- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks from brief to decision
- **DIY cost:** $15 (domain) + $275 (trademark filing) + $0-200 (state registration)
- **Agency cost:** $5,000-50,000+ for professional naming

## Start Now

The longer you wait, the more names get taken. Begin your naming process today, validate your favorites with [BrandScout](/), and secure your brand assets before someone else does.
