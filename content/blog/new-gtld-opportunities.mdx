# New gTLD Opportunities: Beyond .com in 2026

The domain landscape has exploded beyond .com, .net, and .org. With over 1,200 new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) available, there are more opportunities than ever to find the perfect domain for your brand. But not all new extensions are created equal.

## What Are New gTLDs?

New gTLDs are domain extensions introduced after ICANN's 2012 expansion program. They include industry-specific extensions (.tech, .finance), geographic ones (.nyc, .berlin), and general-purpose options (.xyz, .online). This was the biggest expansion of the domain namespace in internet history.

## The Best New gTLDs for Brands

### .app
Backed by Google with mandatory HTTPS, .app is ideal for software companies and mobile app developers. It signals modernity and technical credibility.

### .io
Originally the country code for British Indian Ocean Territory, .io has become the de facto tech startup extension. It's widely recognized in the tech community.

### .ai
The hottest extension in 2026. With the AI boom, .ai domains have skyrocketed in demand and value. If you're building anything AI-related, this is a must-consider.

### .dev
Another Google-backed extension with mandatory HTTPS. Perfect for developer tools, open-source projects, and coding resources.

### .co
Short, memorable, and used by major companies like Twitter (t.co) and Google (g.co). It's the closest alternative to .com in both appearance and recognition.

### .store
Excellent for e-commerce brands. Immediately tells visitors what to expect.

### .design
Perfect for creative agencies, portfolios, and design tools.

## When New gTLDs Make Sense

### Your .com Is Taken or Too Expensive

If "yourbrand.com" costs $50,000 on the aftermarket but "yourbrand.io" is available for $50, the math speaks for itself — especially for early-stage startups.

### The Extension Matches Your Industry

A cybersecurity company using .security or a photography business using .photo creates immediate context.

### You Want a Short, Clean URL

New gTLDs let you get shorter, more memorable domains. "get.app" is cleaner than "gettheappnow.com."

### You're Building a Domain Hack

Extensions like .ly, .to, and .is enable creative URLs: "instant.ly" or "listen.to."

## When to Stick with .com

- **You're targeting a non-technical audience** — Many consumers still default to .com
- **You need maximum credibility** — Enterprise B2B buyers may view new gTLDs with skepticism
- **Email deliverability matters** — Some spam filters are stricter with newer extensions
- **Resale value** — .com domains retain value better than most alternatives

## gTLDs to Approach with Caution

### .xyz
Cheap and popular (Google's parent company uses abc.xyz), but heavily associated with spam due to bulk registrations. Your emails might face deliverability issues.

### .info
Once popular, now heavily associated with spam and low-quality sites.

### .biz
Never gained mainstream acceptance despite being available since 2001.

### Country-code gTLDs you don't belong to
Using .de when you're not in Germany or .ca when you're not in Canada can confuse users and create legal issues.

## SEO Impact of New gTLDs

Google has confirmed that new gTLDs have no inherent SEO advantage or disadvantage compared to .com. Your rankings depend on content, backlinks, and technical SEO — not your extension.

However, a memorable domain gets more direct traffic and more natural backlinks, which indirectly helps SEO. Choose the extension that makes your brand most memorable.

## Pricing Considerations

New gTLD pricing varies wildly:

- **.xyz**: $1-10/year
- **.io**: $30-60/year
- **.ai**: $50-100/year
- **.app**: $15-20/year
- **.dev**: $12-16/year
- **Premium new gTLD domains**: $100-10,000+/year (watch for premium renewal pricing)

Always check the renewal price, not just the first-year promotional rate.
