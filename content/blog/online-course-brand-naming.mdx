## Why Course Names Drive Enrollments

When someone browses Udemy, Skillshare, or your sales page, the course name is the first filter. A clear, compelling name communicates value and gets clicks. A vague one gets scrolled past.

## Naming Your Course vs. Naming Your Brand

There are two distinct naming challenges:

1. **The course brand** — Your teaching identity (e.g., "Coding Academy by Sarah")
2. **Individual course names** — The specific product (e.g., "Python Fundamentals in 30 Days")

This guide covers both, because they need to work together.

## Course Brand Naming Strategies

### Your Name + Niche

"Marie Forleo's B-School" and "Ramit Sethi's Earnable" leverage personal authority. If you have an audience, your name is your brand.

### Academy/School/Lab Format

Adding "Academy," "School," "Lab," or "Institute" signals structured learning:
- Design Lab
- Growth Academy
- Code School

### Invented Names

Platforms like Coursera, Udacity, and Skillshare all use invented names. If you're building a platform rather than a personal brand, this gives you room to grow.

## Individual Course Name Formulas

### The Outcome Promise

Name the result students will achieve:
- "Launch Your Freelance Business"
- "Master Excel in 7 Days"
- "Write Your First Novel"

### The Transformation

Frame it as a before-and-after:
- "From Zero to Data Scientist"
- "Beginner to Pro Photographer"
- "Couch to 5K for Creatives" (metaphorical)

### The Method Name

Create a branded methodology:
- "The PARA Method" (Tiago Forte)
- "The 12 Week Year System"
- "StoryBrand Framework"

This approach is powerful because students associate the method name with your course forever.

## SEO Considerations for Course Names

Course marketplaces have search engines. Optimize for them:

- Include the primary skill or topic in the name
- Add the level (Beginner, Advanced, Masterclass)
- Keep it under ten words
- Avoid jargon that beginners won't search for

On your own website, the course name becomes a URL slug and page title. Both matter for Google rankings.

## Building a Course Brand Identity

Your course brand should extend beyond any single course:

1. **Domain name** — Own your brand's .com for a professional landing page
2. **Social handles** — Build a community around your brand on social platforms
3. **Email list** — Send course updates from a branded domain
4. **Consistent design** — Use the same visual language across all courses

## Naming Mistakes to Avoid

- **Being too vague:** "Business Mastery" could mean anything
- **Being too specific:** "How to Use the Lasso Tool in Photoshop CC 2026" is a video title, not a course name
- **Overusing buzzwords:** "Ultimate," "Definitive," and "Complete" have lost all meaning
- **Copying competitors:** If someone already has "The Complete Web Developer Course," differentiate

## Test Your Course Name

Before launch, validate:

- **Ask your target audience:** Share two to three options in a poll on social media
- **Check search volume:** Use Google Trends to compare interest in different phrasings
- **Preview it on marketplaces:** How does it look in Udemy's search results? Does it stand out?
