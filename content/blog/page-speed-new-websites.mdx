## Speed Is Not Optional

Every second your website takes to load costs you:

- **Visitors:** 53% of mobile users leave after three seconds
- **Revenue:** Amazon found that every 100ms of latency cost 1% in sales
- **Rankings:** Google uses Core Web Vitals (including speed) as ranking factors

A new website has no excuse for being slow. Get it right from the start.

## Measuring Your Page Speed

### Google PageSpeed Insights

Visit pagespeed.web.dev and enter your URL. You'll get:
- A performance score (0–100)
- Core Web Vitals metrics
- Specific recommendations for improvement

### Core Web Vitals Explained

**LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** How long until the main content is visible. Target: under 2.5 seconds.

**INP (Interaction to Next Paint):** How responsive your page is to user input. Target: under 200 milliseconds.

**CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** How much the page layout shifts during loading. Target: under 0.1.

### Other Testing Tools

- **GTmetrix** — Detailed performance analysis with waterfall charts
- **WebPageTest** — Advanced testing from multiple locations
- **Chrome DevTools** — Built into your browser for real-time analysis

## Image Optimization

Images are usually the biggest files on a webpage. Optimize them aggressively:

### Use Modern Formats

- **WebP** — 25-35% smaller than JPEG at equivalent quality. Supported by all modern browsers.
- **AVIF** — Even smaller than WebP but less universally supported. Use with WebP fallback.

### Compress Before Uploading

Use tools like:
- **Squoosh.app** — Google's free image compression tool
- **TinyPNG** — Batch compression for PNG and JPEG
- **ImageOptim** — Desktop app for Mac

### Specify Dimensions

Always include width and height attributes on image tags. This prevents layout shifts (improving CLS).

### Lazy Load Images

Only load images when they scroll into view. Most modern browsers support native lazy loading:

```html
<img src="photo.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Description">
```

### Responsive Images

Serve different image sizes based on the viewer's screen:

```html
<img srcset="photo-400.webp 400w, photo-800.webp 800w, photo-1200.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, 800px" src="photo-800.webp" alt="Description">
```

## Minimize CSS and JavaScript

### Remove Unused Code

New websites built with frameworks or templates often include CSS and JavaScript for features you don't use. Audit and remove what's unnecessary.

### Minify Files

Minification removes whitespace, comments, and shortens variable names:
- Use build tools like Vite, Webpack, or esbuild
- Most website builders handle this automatically

### Defer Non-Critical JavaScript

Scripts that don't affect the initial page load should use the `defer` or `async` attribute:

```html
<script src="analytics.js" defer></script>
```

### Critical CSS

Inline the CSS needed for above-the-fold content directly in the HTML. Load the rest asynchronously.

## Hosting and Server Optimization

### Choose Fast Hosting

Your hosting provider directly impacts speed. For new brands:
- Static hosts (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages) are extremely fast
- Managed WordPress hosts (Kinsta, WP Engine) are optimized for WordPress
- Avoid the cheapest shared hosting plans — they're usually slow

### Use a CDN

A CDN serves your content from servers closest to the visitor. Cloudflare's free plan includes CDN functionality.

### Enable Compression

Gzip or Brotli compression reduces file sizes during transfer. Most modern hosts and CDNs enable this by default.

### Enable Browser Caching

Set cache headers so returning visitors load assets from their browser cache instead of downloading them again.

## Font Optimization

Custom fonts can significantly slow page loads:

- **Limit font weights** — Load only the weights you use (e.g., 400 and 700)
- **Use font-display: swap** — Shows text immediately with a fallback font while the custom font loads
- **Prefer variable fonts** — One file covers multiple weights
- **Self-host fonts** — Faster than loading from Google Fonts in many cases

## Quick Wins for Maximum Impact

If you're overwhelmed, focus on these five changes for the biggest speed improvement:

1. **Compress and convert images to WebP**
2. **Enable a CDN (Cloudflare free tier)**
3. **Lazy load images below the fold**
4. **Defer non-critical JavaScript**
5. **Choose fast hosting**

These five optimizations alone can take a slow site from a 40 PageSpeed score to 80+.
