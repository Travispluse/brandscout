## The Brand Keyword Question

Should you pay for clicks on your own brand name when you'd rank #1 organically anyway? The answer is almost always yes — but the reasons aren't obvious.

## Why Bid on Your Own Brand Name

### Competitor Defense
If you don't bid on your brand name, competitors will. Google allows advertisers to bid on competitor brand names (in most countries). Without your own ad, a competitor's ad sits above your organic listing — capturing clicks from people specifically looking for you.

### Control the Message
Organic search snippets are determined by Google. Paid ads give you full control over the headline, description, and call-to-action. Use this to promote specific offers, highlight differentiators, or direct traffic to optimal landing pages.

### Cheap Clicks
Branded keywords have low competition and high quality scores, resulting in very low cost-per-click — often $0.10-0.50. This is some of the most cost-effective advertising available.

### Real Estate Domination
Running a paid ad + organic listing + Google Business Profile means you occupy most of the first page for branded searches. More real estate = fewer clicks going to competitors.

### Conversion Data
Paid ads provide conversion tracking that organic doesn't. You can measure exactly which branded searches lead to purchases, signups, or other valuable actions.

## Branded Keyword Strategy

### Campaign Setup
Create a dedicated branded keyword campaign separate from your other campaigns:
- **Campaign name:** Brand - [Your Brand Name]
- **Keywords:** Your brand name, common misspellings, brand + product combinations
- **Match type:** Start with exact match and phrase match
- **Budget:** Low — branded clicks are cheap

### Ad Copy Best Practices
- Include your brand name in the headline
- Highlight current promotions or key differentiators
- Use ad extensions (sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets)
- Test multiple ad variations
- Include a clear call-to-action

### Landing Page
Don't send branded traffic to your homepage by default. Test dedicated landing pages with:
- Clear value proposition
- Prominent call-to-action
- Social proof (reviews, customer counts)
- Easy navigation to key pages

## When Competitors Bid on Your Name

### Is It Legal?
In most countries, yes. Competitors can bid on your brand name as a keyword. However, they typically cannot use your brand name in their ad copy — that may constitute trademark infringement.

### How to Respond

**Step 1: Verify it's happening.** Search your brand name in an incognito browser and note which competitors appear.

**Step 2: Bid on your own name.** Your quality score will be much higher than theirs for your brand keyword, so your cost-per-click will be lower and your ad position higher.

**Step 3: Contact the competitor.** Some competitors don't realize they're bidding on your name (broad match keywords can trigger unintended matches). A polite email sometimes resolves it.

**Step 4: File a trademark complaint.** If competitors are using your trademarked name in their ad copy (not just as a keyword), file a complaint through Google's trademark policy.

**Step 5: Consider bidding on their name.** This is a strategic decision — it escalates the situation but can be effective if done thoughtfully.

## Your Brand Name and Ad Performance

Your brand name directly affects paid advertising performance:

### Quality Score Impact
Google evaluates the relevance between the keyword, ad copy, and landing page. A distinctive brand name that appears consistently across all three elements earns a high quality score — meaning lower costs and better positions.

### Click-Through Rate
Distinctive, memorable brand names get higher click-through rates in ads. If someone recognizes your brand name in the ad, they're more likely to click.

### Name Length
Shorter brand names fit better in headlines and display URLs. Google Ads headlines have character limits — a name that uses 25 of your 30 available characters leaves little room for messaging.

## Budget Allocation

For most brands, branded keyword campaigns should represent:
- 5-10% of total ad spend
- 20-40% of total conversions (branded searches convert at much higher rates)

If your branded campaign is consuming more than 15% of budget, investigate why — you might be bidding too aggressively or missing organic ranking opportunities.

## Measuring Brand Campaign Success

Track these metrics for your branded campaigns:
- Impression share (aim for 90%+ on branded terms)
- Cost per click (should be very low)
- Conversion rate (should be your highest)
- Competitor appearance rate (how often competitors show for your brand)

## Name First, Advertise Second

Your paid advertising strategy is only as strong as your brand name. A distinctive, memorable name costs less to advertise and converts better across every channel.
