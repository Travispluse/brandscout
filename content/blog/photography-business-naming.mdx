## Your Name Frames Your Brand

Photographers sell a creative service. Your business name is the frame around everything you create — your portfolio, your website, your Instagram. It should reflect your style and attract your ideal clients.

## Personal Name vs. Brand Name

### Use Your Name When:

- You're a solo photographer and always will be
- You want to build personal recognition in your market
- Your name is distinctive and easy to spell
- You shoot weddings or portraits (clients hire the person)

**Format:** "Sarah Chen Photography" or "Chen Visual" or just "Sarah Chen" with photography implied by the portfolio.

### Use a Brand Name When:

- You plan to build a studio with multiple photographers
- You want to sell the business eventually
- Your personal name is common or hard to spell
- You shoot commercial or stock photography

**Format:** "Lucid Frame Studio" or "Ember & Oak Photography"

## Naming Strategies by Photography Niche

### Wedding Photography

Romance, elegance, and emotion:
- Soft sounds: Luna, Bloom, Whisper
- Nature imagery: Willow, Ivy, Meadow
- Classic pairings: Grace & Gold, Lark & Bloom

### Portrait and Family

Warmth and approachability:
- Studio names: Bright Side Studio, Golden Hour Photography
- Personal touch: Names that feel like a friend, not a corporation

### Commercial and Product

Professionalism and precision:
- Clean, modern names: Pixel Perfect, ClearShot, Frame One
- No-nonsense: The name should sound like a serious business partner

### Fine Art Photography

Creativity and distinctiveness:
- Abstract names: Chroma, Aperture, Parallax
- Artistic references: Names that suggest a point of view

## The Portfolio Test

Your name appears on:
- Your website header
- Watermarks on images
- Business cards
- Instagram profile
- Email signatures

Mock it up in each context. A name that looks elegant on a website might look cramped as a watermark. Test at every size.

## SEO for Photography Businesses

Photography is searched locally. Optimize your name and website for:

- "[City] wedding photographer"
- "[City] headshot photographer"
- "[City] family portraits"

Including your specialty and location on your website (not necessarily in your name) helps Google connect your business to local searches.

## Domain Strategy

For photographers, the domain is the portfolio:

- **Ideal:** yourbrandname.com
- **Alternatives:** yourbrandphoto.com, yourbrand.studio
- **Personal:** firstnamelastname.com

Avoid hyphens and numbers. Clients will type your domain from a business card — make it foolproof.

## Social Media for Photographers

Instagram is the primary discovery platform for most photographers. Your handle should:

- Match your business name exactly
- Be easy to tag (clients tagging you in photos is free marketing)
- Work across platforms (same handle on TikTok, Pinterest, YouTube)

## Common Photography Naming Mistakes

- **Too similar to local competitors:** Search your area's photographers before committing
- **Including "Photography" when it limits you:** If you also do videography, "Sarah Chen Creative" gives more room than "Sarah Chen Photography"
- **Trendy names that won't age:** "Boho Vibes Photography" will feel dated when the trend passes
- **Complicated spellings:** "Phocus Photographie" creates confusion

## The Referral Test

Photography businesses grow through referrals. When a bride tells her friend about you, can she:

- Remember the name?
- Spell it correctly?
- Find you on Google or Instagram?

If any answer is no, simplify your name.
