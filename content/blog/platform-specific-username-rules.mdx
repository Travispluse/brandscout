## Every Platform Is Different

You've picked the perfect brand name — then discover it contains a character that's not allowed on one of your key platforms. Understanding each platform's username rules before finalizing your name prevents last-minute surprises.

## Instagram

### Rules
- **Length:** 1-30 characters
- **Allowed characters:** Letters, numbers, periods, underscores
- **Case:** Case-insensitive (BrandName = brandname)
- **No spaces, hyphens, or special characters**

### Notes
- Usernames must be unique — no two accounts can have the same name
- Periods and underscores at the beginning/end may cause issues
- Display name (separate from username) allows more flexibility: up to 64 characters including spaces and emoji

### Best Practice
Keep it short (under 15 characters), avoid periods and underscores if possible, and use only lowercase letters.

## X (Twitter)

### Rules
- **Length:** 1-15 characters
- **Allowed characters:** Letters, numbers, underscores
- **Case:** Case-insensitive
- **No periods, hyphens, or special characters**

### Notes
- The 15-character limit is the most restrictive of any major platform
- Underscores are common in Twitter handles but can look cluttered
- Display name allows up to 50 characters

### Best Practice
Twitter's 15-character limit should be your primary constraint when choosing a brand name. If your name doesn't fit in 15 characters (including a modifier like "get" or "hq"), reconsider.

## TikTok

### Rules
- **Length:** 2-24 characters
- **Allowed characters:** Letters, numbers, underscores, periods
- **Case:** Case-insensitive
- **Usernames can only be changed every 30 days**

### Notes
- New accounts get assigned a random username (user12345678) that should be changed immediately
- Similar to Instagram in allowed characters
- TikTok is more lenient about releasing inactive usernames

### Best Practice
Claim your TikTok handle early, even if you're not posting content yet. TikTok's algorithm favors early movers.

## LinkedIn

### Company Page URL Rules
- **Format:** linkedin.com/company/your-name
- **Length:** 3-100 characters
- **Allowed characters:** Letters, numbers, hyphens
- **No underscores, periods, or special characters**

### Personal Profile URL Rules
- **Format:** linkedin.com/in/your-name
- **Length:** 3-100 characters
- **Allowed characters:** Letters, numbers, hyphens

### Notes
- LinkedIn URLs allow hyphens but NOT underscores (opposite of Twitter)
- Company page URLs can be changed but only a limited number of times
- Display name is separate and follows your real name

### Best Practice
Register your company page URL early. LinkedIn makes URL changes difficult.

## YouTube

### Rules
- **Handle format:** @username
- **Length:** 3-30 characters
- **Allowed characters:** Letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, periods
- **Must be unique**

### Notes
- YouTube handles (introduced 2022) are separate from channel names
- Custom URLs require 100+ subscribers and a 30-day-old channel
- Handles are the most flexible in terms of allowed characters

### Best Practice
Claim your YouTube handle as soon as you create a channel, even before uploading.

## Facebook (Business Pages)

### Rules
- **Custom URL format:** facebook.com/yourname
- **Length:** 5-50 characters
- **Allowed characters:** Letters, numbers, periods
- **Must have 25+ page likes to claim a custom URL**

### Notes
- Facebook page names and URLs are separate — you can have a longer page name with a shorter URL
- Changing your page URL is restricted to prevent abuse

## Threads

### Rules
- **Uses your Instagram username automatically**
- Same character rules as Instagram
- Cannot have a different username on Threads vs Instagram

### Notes
- If you claim a name on Instagram, you automatically have it on Threads
- This is another reason to prioritize Instagram username selection

## The Universal Username Strategy

Given all these different rules, your safest bet is the lowest common denominator:

- **Lowercase letters and numbers only**
- **Under 15 characters** (Twitter's limit)
- **No periods, underscores, or hyphens**
- **Pronounceable and memorable**

If your brand name meets these criteria, it will work everywhere.
