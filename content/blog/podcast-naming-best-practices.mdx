## Your Podcast Name Is Your Billboard

Podcast listeners browse directories like Apple Podcasts and Spotify the way people browse bookstore shelves. Your name is the cover. It needs to intrigue, inform, and invite — all in a few words.

## The Three Types of Podcast Names

### Descriptive Names

These tell you exactly what the show is about. "The Marketing Over Coffee Podcast" or "Sleep With Me" leave no ambiguity. They're great for search but can feel limiting.

**Best for:** Niche topics where discoverability matters most.

### Creative or Abstract Names

"Radiolab," "Freakonomics," "Serial." These names don't describe the content directly but become synonymous with the show through great content and marketing.

**Best for:** Shows with strong marketing support or unique formats.

### Host-Driven Names

"The Tim Ferriss Show," "Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend." If you have an existing audience, your name is the brand.

**Best for:** Established personalities with built-in audiences.

## Podcast SEO: Why Keywords Matter

Apple Podcasts and Spotify use your podcast name as a ranking signal. Including a relevant keyword helps new listeners find you:

- "The Lazy Genius Podcast" ranks for "genius" and related queries
- "How I Built This" ranks for entrepreneurship-related searches

But don't overdo it. "The Best Marketing Business Growth Entrepreneurship Podcast" is spam, and Apple will reject it.

## Keep It Short

The ideal podcast name is two to five words. Long names get truncated in podcast apps, especially on mobile. If your full name doesn't fit on screen, listeners see an ellipsis instead of your brand.

Test how your name displays:
- iPhone podcast app (narrow screens)
- Spotify player
- Google Podcasts web interface

## Make It Speakable

Podcast discovery is heavily word-of-mouth. "Have you listened to..." needs to flow naturally. Test your name by saying "You should check out [name]" to five people. If they ask you to repeat it or spell it, simplify.

## Check Across All Platforms

Before recording your first episode:

1. Search Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and YouTube for your name
2. Check if the matching domain is available for your show's website
3. Verify social media handles on Instagram, Twitter/X, and TikTok
4. Look for trademark conflicts

## Podcast Name Formulas That Work

### [Topic] + [Format]
- Business Breakdowns
- History Unplugged
- Science Explained

### [Adjective] + [Noun]
- Hidden Brain
- Rough Translation
- Tiny Desk

### [Question or Action]
- How Did This Get Made?
- Stuff You Should Know
- What Got You There?

## When to Add "Podcast" to Your Name

Generally, skip it. "Podcast" in your title wastes characters and sounds redundant — you're already in a podcast directory. Exception: if your name is so generic that adding "Podcast" helps with search clarity.

## Planning for Growth

Choose a name that can grow with you:

- If you start solo but might add co-hosts, avoid "The [YourName] Show"
- If you might expand topics, don't name it too narrowly
- If you plan a network, make the show name work independently of a network brand
