## Why PR for a New Brand?

A single article in the right publication can drive more traffic and credibility than months of social media posting. PR coverage provides:
- **Third-party validation** — A journalist chose to write about you
- **SEO backlinks** — Media sites have high domain authority
- **Credibility** — "As seen in..." is powerful social proof
- **Reach** — Access to audiences you couldn't reach on your own

## Building Your PR Foundation

### Craft Your Press Kit
Before pitching anyone, prepare these assets:
- **Brand story** — One page, compelling, newsworthy angle
- **Founder bio** — Professional headshot and 200-word biography
- **Product/service description** — Clear, jargon-free explanation
- **High-resolution images** — Logo, product photos, founder photos
- **Key facts** — Founding date, team size, notable metrics
- **Contact information** — Direct email and phone for media inquiries

Host your press kit on your website (/press or /media) so journalists can access it anytime.

### Define Your Newsworthy Angle
"We launched a company" is not newsworthy. Journalists need a story, not an announcement. Newsworthy angles include:
- **Trend:** Your brand represents or responds to a larger industry trend
- **Data:** You have original research or surprising statistics
- **Conflict:** You're challenging an industry norm or established player
- **Human interest:** Your founder story is genuinely compelling
- **Timing:** Your launch connects to a current event or cultural moment

### Identify Target Publications
Create a tiered list:
- **Tier 1:** Major publications (TechCrunch, Forbes, Fast Company) — hardest to get, highest impact
- **Tier 2:** Industry publications and blogs — easier to get, highly relevant audience
- **Tier 3:** Local media, podcasts, newsletters — most accessible, builds momentum

Start with Tier 3 and work up. Coverage begets coverage — journalists check if others have written about you.

## The Pitch

### Find the Right Journalist
Don't pitch the publication — pitch the specific journalist who covers your beat. Research who writes about your industry, what they've covered recently, and what angles interest them.

Tools to find journalists: Muck Rack, Twitter/X lists, publication mastheads, LinkedIn.

### Write a Compelling Pitch Email
Subject line: Specific and interesting. Not "Press Release" or "New Company Launch."

Structure:
1. **Hook (1 sentence):** Why should they care right now?
2. **Context (2-3 sentences):** What's the trend or problem?
3. **Your brand (2-3 sentences):** What you do and why it matters
4. **The ask (1 sentence):** Would they like to learn more, get a demo, or interview the founder?
5. **Key details:** Include the most impressive fact or metric

Keep the entire email under 200 words. Journalists receive hundreds of pitches daily — brevity is respect.

### Follow Up
One follow-up email three to five days after the initial pitch is appropriate. If you don't hear back after the follow-up, move on. Never send more than two emails.

## Timing Your PR Campaign

### Pre-Launch (2-4 Weeks Before)
- Send embargoed pitches to top-tier journalists (they get exclusivity in exchange for covering you on launch day)
- Pitch podcasts (they have longer lead times)
- Prepare all assets

### Launch Week
- Publish your press release
- Blast pitches to Tier 2 and 3 publications
- Share any coverage on social media immediately
- Follow up with interested journalists

### Post-Launch (Ongoing)
- Continue relationship-building with journalists
- Pitch follow-up stories (growth milestones, customer stories, industry commentary)
- Offer yourself as an expert source for relevant stories

## DIY PR vs. Hiring an Agency

### DIY PR Works When:
- Your founder is a good storyteller and communicator
- You have a genuinely newsworthy story
- You're willing to invest time in research and outreach
- Budget is limited (most startups)

### Hire an Agency When:
- You need guaranteed placements for a funding round or major launch
- You don't have time for outreach
- You need ongoing media relationships
- Budget allows $3,000-15,000/month

## Common PR Mistakes

**Mass emailing press releases.** Spray-and-pray pitching annoys journalists and gets you blacklisted. Personalize every pitch.

**No newsworthy angle.** "We exist" is not news. Find the story within your story.

**Bad timing.** Don't pitch during major news events when journalists are focused elsewhere. Avoid Fridays and Mondays.

**Ignoring follow-through.** When a journalist responds, reply within the hour. Provide everything they ask for immediately. Being easy to work with earns repeat coverage.

## Before the Press Arrives

When journalists check out your brand, they'll search for your website, social media, and online presence. Make sure everything is professional and consistent.

Use [BrandScout](/) to verify your brand name is secured across all platforms before media coverage sends people searching for you.
