# SaaS Naming Patterns: How the Best Software Companies Name Their Products

The SaaS industry has developed distinct naming conventions that signal credibility, modernity, and utility. Understanding these patterns helps you create a name that fits the ecosystem while standing out.

## Pattern 1: The Invented Word

**Examples**: Salesforce, Atlassian, Asana, Zendesk, Datadog

Created words that become synonymous with their category. These names are completely ownable — no trademark conflicts, strong domain availability, and total brand control.

**When to use**: When you want maximum brand ownership and plan to define a category.

## Pattern 2: The Real Word Repurposed

**Examples**: Slack, Notion, Stripe, Square, Monday

Common English words given new context. These benefit from built-in familiarity and easy pronunciation but face domain challenges (you'll likely need the .com from the aftermarket).

**When to use**: When you want instant memorability and have budget for premium domains.

## Pattern 3: The Compound Word

**Examples**: HubSpot, Dropbox, Mailchimp, Basecamp, Clickup

Two words combined into one. These communicate function while remaining brandable. They're a sweet spot between descriptive and creative.

**When to use**: When you want clarity about what you do without being generic.

## Pattern 4: The Suffix Play

**Examples**: Shopify (-ify), Grammarly (-ly), Hootsuite (-suite), Intercom (-com)

Adding a suffix to a root word creates a modern, action-oriented name. Common SaaS suffixes:
- **-ify**: Implies transformation (Shopify, Spotify, Justfy)
- **-ly**: Implies manner or method (Grammarly, Bitly, Assembly)
- **-io**: Implies tech (Calendly uses .com but many SaaS use .io)

## Pattern 5: The Abstract

**Examples**: Figma, Miro, Loom, Airtable, Canva

Short, often two-syllable names that don't describe the product but feel modern and tech-forward. These require more marketing spend to establish meaning but are highly brandable.

**When to use**: When you're building a platform that may expand beyond its initial use case.

## B2B vs B2C SaaS Naming

### B2B Naming
- Slightly more descriptive (buyers need to justify purchases)
- Professional tone
- Often includes the problem space: Salesforce (sales), ServiceNow (service)

### B2C SaaS Naming
- More playful and memorable
- Emotional resonance matters more
- Shorter names perform better
- Brand personality is a bigger factor

## What Investors Look for in SaaS Names

- **Ownable**: Can you get the .com and trademark?
- **Category potential**: Does the name allow you to expand?
- **Memorable**: Will LPs remember it from a pitch deck?
- **Professional**: Does it signal a real business, not a side project?

## Check Your SaaS Name
