## The New Domain Challenge

A brand-new domain has no history, no backlinks, and no authority in Google's eyes. While there's no penalty for being new, you're starting from scratch. The good news: if you set up SEO correctly from day one, you'll build authority faster than competitors who treat it as an afterthought.

## Technical SEO Foundation

### Set Up Google Search Console

This is step one. Google Search Console (GSC) is free and tells you:
- Whether Google can find and index your pages
- What search queries drive traffic to your site
- Any technical errors preventing indexing

Verify your domain immediately after launch.

### Submit Your Sitemap

A sitemap tells Google which pages exist on your site. Most website builders generate one automatically. Submit it in GSC under Sitemaps → Add a new sitemap (usually yourbrand.com/sitemap.xml).

### Ensure Your Site Is Crawlable

Check that your robots.txt file isn't blocking search engines. Common mistake: leaving a "noindex" tag from development that prevents Google from indexing your live site.

### Enable HTTPS

SSL is a ranking factor. Every modern host offers free SSL. Make sure all pages load over HTTPS and HTTP redirects to HTTPS.

### Optimize Page Speed

Fast sites rank better. For a new site:
- Compress images (use WebP format)
- Minimize CSS and JavaScript
- Use a CDN
- Choose fast hosting

## On-Page SEO Essentials

### Title Tags

Every page needs a unique, descriptive title tag under 60 characters. Include your primary keyword naturally.

**Good:** "Handmade Leather Wallets | YourBrand"
**Bad:** "Home | YourBrand" or "YourBrand | Best Wallets | Cheap Wallets | Buy Wallets"

### Meta Descriptions

Write compelling descriptions under 160 characters for every page. These appear in search results and influence click-through rates. They're not a direct ranking factor, but higher CTR indirectly helps rankings.

### Header Structure

Use H1 for page titles (one per page), H2 for section headings, H3 for subsections. Include keywords naturally in headings.

### Internal Linking

Link between your own pages. Every page should be reachable within three clicks from the homepage. Internal links help Google discover pages and understand your site structure.

### Image Optimization

- Use descriptive file names (leather-wallet-brown.jpg, not IMG_4523.jpg)
- Add alt text to every image
- Compress images without quality loss
- Specify image dimensions

## Content Strategy for New Domains

### Start With Cornerstone Content

Create five to ten comprehensive pages targeting your most important keywords. These are your pillar pages — deep, authoritative content on your core topics.

### Target Long-Tail Keywords First

New domains can't compete for "leather wallets" immediately. Target "handmade full-grain leather bifold wallets" instead. Less competition, more specific intent, and faster rankings.

### Publish Consistently

Google rewards sites that regularly publish quality content. Set a realistic schedule (weekly is great, biweekly is fine) and stick to it.

### Answer Questions

Use tools like "People Also Ask" in Google search, AnswerThePublic, or AlsoAsked.com to find questions your audience asks. Create content that answers them thoroughly.

## Building Authority

### Get Your First Backlinks

New domains need backlinks to build authority:
- Create profiles on relevant business directories
- Submit to industry-specific listings
- Reach out to partners for mentions
- Create shareable content that naturally attracts links

### Build Social Signals

While social media isn't a direct ranking factor, it drives traffic and exposes your content to people who might link to it.

### Claim Your Business Listings

For local brands, set up:
- Google Business Profile
- Bing Places
- Apple Maps
- Industry-specific directories

## What to Avoid

- **Buying backlinks** — Google penalizes this
- **Keyword stuffing** — Unnatural keyword repetition hurts rankings
- **Duplicate content** — Every page should be unique
- **Thin content** — Pages with little value get filtered out
- **Ignoring mobile** — Google uses mobile-first indexing
