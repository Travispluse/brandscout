# Snapchat Username Tips: Get Your Brand Name on Snap

Snapchat remains a powerhouse for reaching younger audiences, with over 750 million monthly active users. Your Snapchat username is permanent, so getting it right the first time is critical.

## Snapchat Username Rules

- **Length**: 3-15 characters
- **Characters**: Letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, and periods
- **Permanence**: You cannot change your Snapchat username. It's permanent.
- **Display name**: You can change your display name, but not the underlying username
- **Case insensitive**: "MyBrand" and "mybrand" are the same

## The Permanent Username Problem

Snapchat is one of the few major platforms where you absolutely cannot change your username. This makes the initial choice extremely important. If you register "mybrand2024" and later want "mybrand," you're stuck.

### Workaround: New Account
The only way to change your username is to create a new account. This means losing all your friends, Snap score, Memories, and Bitmoji connections. For personal accounts, this is annoying. For brand accounts with followers, it can be devastating.

## Choosing Your Snapchat Username

### Match Your Brand
Use your brand name exactly as it appears elsewhere. Consistency across platforms is more important on Snapchat because you can't fix it later.

### Keep It Short
With a 15-character limit, brevity is forced. But shorter is still better within that constraint. "acme" beats "acmecompanyinc."

### Make It Speakable
Snapchat is popular among younger users who share usernames verbally. If someone can't say your username and have the other person type it correctly, it's too complicated.

### Avoid Dates and Numbers
Since you can't change it, "acme2026" will look dated by 2028. Use your core brand name without temporal markers.

### Skip Underscores and Periods When Possible
While allowed, they add complexity when sharing verbally. "acme.brand" requires explaining "acme dot brand" — friction that loses followers.

## Snapchat for Business

### Business Accounts
Snapchat offers business accounts with additional features:
- Snap Ads management
- Analytics and insights
- Branded lenses and filters
- Public profiles

### Public Profiles
Brands can create public profiles that function like a storefront within Snapchat, showcasing Snaps, Stories, lenses, and shop links.

### Snapchat Discover
For media brands and publishers, Snapchat Discover is a major content distribution channel with curated, immersive content experiences.

## Snapchat Advertising and Branded Content

### Sponsored Lenses
Augmented reality lenses branded with your name — among the most engaging ad formats on any platform.

### Geofilters
Location-based overlays for events, stores, and venues. Your brand name appears as users share snaps from your location.

### Snap Ads
Full-screen vertical video ads that appear between Stories and Discover content.

## Demographics and Strategy

Snapchat's core audience is 13-34 year olds. If your brand targets this demographic:
- Embrace ephemeral, authentic content
- Use AR lenses and filters
- Partner with Snapchat creators
- Create content that feels native to the platform, not repurposed from Instagram

## Snapcode Strategy

Your Snapcode (the scannable QR code) is tied to your username. Display it on:
- Business cards and marketing materials
- Website and social profiles
- Event signage and packaging
- Email signatures

## Claim Your Username Now

Since Snapchat usernames are permanent and can't be changed, claim yours now — even if you're not ready to actively use the platform.

Check your brand name availability across Snapchat and other platforms with [BrandScout](/). Secure a consistent identity before someone else claims your name permanently.
