## Your Handle Is Your Brand's Digital Address

Your social media handle is how people find you, tag you, mention you, and share you. It appears in every interaction — from comments and DMs to press mentions and word-of-mouth referrals. Getting it right is fundamental to your brand's digital presence.

## Best Practice 1: Match Your Domain

Your social handle should match your domain as closely as possible. If your website is acme.com, your handle should be @acme. This creates a seamless brand experience: customers can guess your social profiles from your website and vice versa.

When an exact match isn't possible, use the same variation everywhere: if @acme is taken, use @acmehq on *every* platform.

## Best Practice 2: Keep It Short

Shorter handles are:
- Easier to remember
- Easier to type (especially on mobile)
- Less likely to be misspelled
- More visually clean in mentions and tags

**Target:** 6-12 characters. Under 15 is acceptable. Over 15 is problematic (Twitter won't even allow it).

## Best Practice 3: Make It Speakable

People share social handles verbally: "Follow us at brandname on Instagram." If your handle is hard to say out loud, it won't spread through word of mouth.

**Test:** Say "Follow us at [handle]" out loud. Does it flow naturally? Would someone understand it on the first try?

## Best Practice 4: Avoid Numbers

Numbers in handles (@brand123) look unprofessional and suggest you couldn't get the real handle. The only exception: if the number is part of your actual brand name (like @7eleven).

## Best Practice 5: Avoid Underscores and Periods

While platforms allow these characters, they create problems:
- Harder to communicate verbally ("at brand underscore name")
- Easy to forget or mix up
- Look cluttered, especially in mentions
- Some platforms allow one but not the other

If you must use a separator, pick one and use it consistently everywhere.

## Best Practice 6: Be Consistent Across Platforms

Same handle. Every platform. No exceptions if possible.

Inconsistency confuses customers and weakens brand recognition. If someone follows @brandname on Instagram and searches @brandname on TikTok, they should find you — not someone else.

## Best Practice 7: Secure Handles on Platforms You Don't Use Yet

Register your handle on every major platform the day you decide on your brand name:
- Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook, Threads, Pinterest

Even if you won't post on Pinterest for years, claim the handle now. It costs nothing and prevents squatters.

## Best Practice 8: Complete Your Profiles

An empty profile with just a username looks like a squatter account. On every platform, immediately add:
- Profile picture (your logo)
- Bio with a one-line description
- Website link
- A pinned post or initial post

This prevents platforms from flagging the account as inactive.

## Best Practice 9: Use Your Display Name Strategically

Most platforms separate your handle (fixed, used for @mentions) from your display name (flexible, visible to browsers).

Use your handle for brand consistency: @brandname
Use your display name for discoverability: "BrandName | Project Management Tool"

The display name can include keywords that help people find you in search.

## Best Practice 10: Monitor for Imposters

Once you've established your handles, monitor for accounts using similar names:
- @brand.name, @brand_name, @brandnamee
- Accounts using your logo or bio

Report impersonators immediately through each platform's intellectual property tools.

## The Handle Selection Process

1. Choose your brand name
2. Check handle availability on all platforms simultaneously
3. If available everywhere → register immediately
4. If taken on some platforms → evaluate alternatives (modifiers, contacting holders)
5. Choose the best universally available option
6. Register on all platforms the same day

## Start With Availability

Don't go through this process manually. Use [BrandScout](/) to check your brand name across all major social media platforms, domains, and trademarks in one search — and find a name that works everywhere.
