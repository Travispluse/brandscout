## Don't Just Post — Launch

Most new brands create social accounts and start posting randomly. That's not a launch strategy — that's noise. A real social media launch is orchestrated, timed, and designed to create momentum.

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch (4-6 Weeks Before)

### Secure Your Handles
Before announcing anything, claim your brand name on every major platform. Even if you don't plan to use TikTok today, claim the handle. Consistency matters, and squatters move fast.

Priority platforms:
- Instagram
- Twitter/X
- TikTok
- LinkedIn
- YouTube
- Pinterest (if visual product)
- Threads

### Choose Your Focus Platforms
You cannot effectively launch on seven platforms simultaneously. Pick two or three where your target audience actually spends time:
- **B2C visual products:** Instagram + TikTok
- **B2B services:** LinkedIn + Twitter/X
- **Local businesses:** Instagram + Facebook
- **Tech/developer:** Twitter/X + YouTube

### Build a Content Bank
Create 20-30 pieces of content before launch. You won't have time to create content and manage engagement simultaneously during launch week.

Content types to prepare:
- Brand story / origin posts
- Behind-the-scenes creation process
- Product teasers (reveal little by little)
- Founder introduction
- Value-driven educational content
- User-generated content templates

## Phase 2: Teaser Campaign (2-3 Weeks Before)

### Create Anticipation
Start posting before the official launch:
- Day 1: Cryptic teaser ("Something new is coming...")
- Day 3: Reveal a hint (brand color, partial logo)
- Day 5: Share the problem you're solving
- Day 7: Reveal the brand name
- Day 10: Show the product or service
- Day 14: Announce launch date with countdown

### Build an Early Audience
- Follow relevant accounts in your niche
- Engage genuinely with potential customers' content
- Join relevant conversations using industry hashtags
- Create a launch landing page to collect email signups
- Offer early access or launch-day discounts to pre-launch followers

## Phase 3: Launch Day

### The Launch Post
Your main launch post should:
- Tell your brand story concisely
- Show the product or service clearly
- Include a direct call-to-action
- Use a launch-specific hashtag
- Tag relevant accounts (not spam — genuine connections)

### Launch Day Content Calendar
Don't post once and wait. Plan a full day of content:
- **Morning:** Main launch announcement
- **Midday:** Behind-the-scenes / founder message
- **Afternoon:** Customer benefit highlight or demo
- **Evening:** Thank you post / first-day recap

### Engagement Protocol
For the first 48 hours, respond to every single comment, DM, and mention. Speed of response during launch directly correlates with algorithm boost and follower conversion.

## Phase 4: Post-Launch Momentum (Weeks 1-4)

### Content Cadence
Maintain a consistent posting schedule:
- Instagram: 4-5 posts per week + daily stories
- Twitter/X: 1-3 posts per day
- LinkedIn: 3-4 posts per week
- TikTok: 3-5 videos per week

### Engagement Strategy
- Respond to every comment within two hours
- Create content that encourages saves and shares (not just likes)
- Ask questions in captions to drive comments
- Share user-generated content immediately
- Collaborate with micro-influencers for cross-promotion

### Paid Amplification
Allocate a small budget ($200-1,000) to boost your best-performing organic launch content. Boosting content that's already performing well gives you the best ROI on launch spend.

## Measuring Launch Success

Track these metrics for the first 30 days:

- **Follower growth rate** — Are you building an audience?
- **Engagement rate** — Is the audience engaged? (Aim for 3-5% on Instagram)
- **Website traffic from social** — Is social driving real business action?
- **DM conversations** — Are potential customers reaching out?
- **Brand mention volume** — Are people talking about you?

## Common Launch Mistakes

**Launching on too many platforms.** Focus beats spread. Two platforms done well outperform seven done poorly.

**Selling too hard, too fast.** Your first posts should build connection, not push products. The ratio should be 80% value, 20% promotion.

**Inconsistent posting after launch.** The post-launch drop-off is the most common failure. Maintain your cadence for at least 90 days.

**Ignoring DMs.** Direct messages are where conversions happen. Treat every DM as a sales conversation.

## Before You Launch

A successful social media launch requires consistent branding across every platform. That starts with having the same handle everywhere.
