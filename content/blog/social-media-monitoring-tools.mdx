## Why Social Media Monitoring Is Essential

Eighty percent of brand mentions on social media go unanswered. Every unanswered mention is a missed opportunity — to help a customer, thank a fan, or correct misinformation. Social media monitoring ensures you never miss a conversation about your brand.

## What to Monitor

### Direct Mentions

When someone tags or @mentions your brand. Most platforms notify you of these, but tools help you track them centrally.

### Indirect Mentions

When someone talks about your brand without tagging you. "Just tried that new coffee from [brand name] and it's amazing" — you'd never see this without monitoring tools.

### Hashtags

Branded hashtags (#YourBrand) and campaign-specific tags (#YourBrandLaunch).

### Competitors

What people say about your competitors reveals market opportunities and threats.

### Industry Keywords

Terms related to your industry help you find potential customers and trending topics.

- Native platform notifications (free)
- Google Alerts for web coverage (free)
- One monitoring tool for centralized tracking (free trial or affordable paid)

### Step 3: Create a Response Protocol

Define how your team handles different types of mentions:

- **Positive reviews:** Thank within 24 hours, share if appropriate
- **Customer complaints:** Respond within one hour during business hours
- **Brand misinformation:** Correct politely with facts
- **Crisis mentions:** Escalate immediately to designated team member

### Step 4: Establish a Routine

- Check monitoring dashboard three times daily (morning, midday, evening)
- Review weekly summary reports
- Adjust keywords monthly based on what you're finding

## Social Media Monitoring Metrics

Track these KPIs:

- **Volume:** How often is your brand mentioned?
- **Sentiment:** What percentage is positive, negative, neutral?
- **Reach:** How many people see mentions of your brand?
- **Response time:** How quickly do you respond?
- **Share of voice:** How do your mentions compare to competitors?

## Common Monitoring Mistakes

- **Only tracking @mentions** — Most brand conversations happen without tags
- **Ignoring negative sentiment** — Silence amplifies complaints
- **Over-monitoring without acting** — Data is useless without response
- **Not monitoring visual mentions** — Your logo in images without text mentions
