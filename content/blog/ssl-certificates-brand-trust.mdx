## The Padlock That Builds Trust

When visitors see the padlock icon in their browser, they trust your site. When they see "Not Secure," they leave. SSL certificates enable HTTPS, encrypting data between your visitor's browser and your server. For any brand website, this is non-negotiable.

## What SSL Actually Does

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) — technically TLS (Transport Layer Security) in its modern form — provides three things:

1. **Encryption:** Data traveling between the browser and server is scrambled, preventing eavesdropping
2. **Authentication:** Confirms that visitors are connecting to your actual server, not an impersonator
3. **Data integrity:** Ensures data isn't modified during transmission

## Why Your Brand Needs SSL

### Browser Warnings

Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge all flag HTTP sites as "Not Secure." This warning appears in the URL bar where everyone can see it. For a brand trying to build trust, this is devastating.

### SEO Rankings

Google confirmed HTTPS as a ranking signal. While it's a minor factor compared to content quality, every competitive advantage matters. All else being equal, HTTPS sites rank higher.

### Customer Trust

E-commerce stores, contact forms, login pages — any interaction where users share data requires SSL. But even static brochure sites benefit. The padlock signals professionalism.

### Compliance

GDPR, PCI DSS, and other regulations require encrypted data transmission. If your site collects any personal data (even a contact form email), SSL helps you comply.

## Types of SSL Certificates

### Domain Validation (DV)

- Verifies you control the domain
- Issued in minutes
- Free through Let's Encrypt or Cloudflare
- **Best for:** Most brand websites

### Organization Validation (OV)

- Verifies your organization's identity
- Issued in one to three days
- Costs $50–$200/year
- **Best for:** Businesses wanting extra credibility

### Extended Validation (EV)

- Thorough identity verification
- Issued in one to two weeks
- Costs $100–$500/year
- **Best for:** Banks, large e-commerce, institutions

For most brands, a free DV certificate is perfectly adequate.

## How to Get an SSL Certificate

### Free Options

**Let's Encrypt:** Free, automated, widely supported. Most web hosts integrate it.

**Cloudflare:** Free SSL included with their free plan. Simply point your DNS to Cloudflare.

**Your hosting provider:** Many hosts (Netlify, Vercel, Squarespace, Shopify) include free SSL automatically.

### Paid Options

If you need OV or EV certificates, providers include DigiCert, Comodo, and GlobalSign. Purchase through your registrar or a dedicated SSL provider.

## Setting Up SSL

### On Managed Platforms

Squarespace, Shopify, Wix, WordPress.com, Netlify, and Vercel handle SSL automatically. Just connect your domain and SSL is configured.

### On Self-Hosted WordPress

1. Install an SSL certificate through your host (most offer one-click Let's Encrypt)
2. Update WordPress settings to use HTTPS
3. Install a plugin like "Really Simple SSL" to handle redirects
4. Update internal links and mixed content

### On Custom Servers

1. Generate a certificate signing request (CSR)
2. Submit to a certificate authority
3. Install the certificate on your server
4. Configure redirects from HTTP to HTTPS

## Common SSL Mistakes

### Mixed Content

Your site loads over HTTPS, but some resources (images, scripts, CSS) still load over HTTP. Browsers flag this. Fix by updating all resource URLs to HTTPS.

### Expired Certificates

SSL certificates expire (typically every 90 days for Let's Encrypt, annually for paid certs). Set up auto-renewal to avoid your site suddenly showing "Not Secure."

### Not Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS

Both versions of your site shouldn't exist. Set up a 301 redirect from HTTP to HTTPS so all visitors get the secure version.

### Wrong Certificate for Subdomains

A certificate for yourbrand.com doesn't cover blog.yourbrand.com. You need a wildcard certificate (*.yourbrand.com) or separate certificates for each subdomain.

## SSL and Performance

Modern SSL has negligible performance impact. TLS 1.3, HTTP/2, and OCSP stapling have eliminated the "SSL is slow" concern. In fact, HTTP/2 (which requires HTTPS) often makes SSL sites faster than HTTP sites.

## Your SSL Checklist

- [ ] SSL certificate installed
- [ ] HTTP redirects to HTTPS
- [ ] No mixed content warnings
- [ ] Certificate auto-renewal configured
- [ ] Subdomains covered
- [ ] HSTS header enabled (tells browsers to always use HTTPS)

Before setting up SSL, you need the right domain. Use [BrandScout](/) to find an available domain for your brand, then secure it with SSL from day one.
