## When Do You Need a Sub-Brand?

You need a sub-brand when a new product or service is different enough from your core offering that it needs its own identity, but related enough that it benefits from association with the parent brand.

Common triggers:
- Entering a new market segment
- Launching a premium or budget tier
- Acquiring a company
- Creating a product with a fundamentally different audience

## Sub-Brand Naming Approaches

### Descriptive Modifiers
Add a descriptive word to the parent brand name.

**Examples:** iPhone Pro, Google Workspace, Amazon Prime

**When it works:** When the parent brand is strong enough to carry the name and the modifier clearly communicates the difference. This is the simplest approach and the one most small businesses should start with.

### Invented Sub-Names
Create a new word that lives alongside the parent brand.

**Examples:** Microsoft Azure, Apple Siri, Adobe Firefly

**When it works:** When the sub-brand needs its own personality and might eventually become a standalone brand. Invented names require more marketing investment but offer stronger differentiation.

### Thematic Naming
Use a consistent theme across all sub-brands to create a recognizable family.

**Examples:** Apple's product line uses clean, common English words (Watch, TV, Music). Amazon uses service-oriented language (Prime, Fresh, Basics).

**When it works:** When you have or expect to have multiple sub-brands and want them to feel related without being identical.

### Alphanumeric Naming
Use letters, numbers, or codes to differentiate versions.

**Examples:** BMW 3 Series, iPhone 16, PlayStation 5

**When it works:** When products are iterative and exist on a clear spectrum. Numbers imply hierarchy and progress. But they lack personality and are hard to differentiate emotionally.

## Key Principles for Sub-Brand Names

### 1. The Parent Brand Should Be Recognizable
When someone hears the sub-brand name, the parent brand connection should be clear — either through the name itself or consistent visual branding.

### 2. The Sub-Brand Should Add Meaning
The sub-brand name should communicate something the parent name doesn't. If "Acme Pro" doesn't feel meaningfully different from "Acme," the sub-brand isn't working.

### 3. Names Should Be Easy to Say Together
Say the full name out loud: parent + sub-brand. Does it flow naturally? "Google Workspace" rolls off the tongue. "Alphabet Verily" feels disjointed. Rhythm matters.

### 4. Plan for Expansion
If this is your first sub-brand, assume it won't be your last. Choose a naming approach that scales. If you call your first sub-product "Acme Bolt," you're implicitly committing to short, punchy sub-names for everything that follows.

## Building a Sub-Brand Naming System

### Document Your Naming Rules
Write down the principles that will govern all future sub-brand names:
- Naming structure (parent + modifier, parent + invented name, etc.)
- Tone and style guidelines
- Approval process
- Trademark and availability requirements

### Create a Name Bank
Proactively generate and vet potential sub-brand names before you need them. When a new product launches, you'll have pre-approved options ready.

### Assign Naming Authority
Decide who has final say on sub-brand names. Without clear authority, naming decisions become political battles that delay launches.

## Mistakes to Avoid

**Creating too many sub-brands.** Every sub-brand dilutes attention and resources. Be ruthless about whether a new offering truly needs its own name or can live under the parent brand.

**Inconsistent naming styles.** If one sub-brand is descriptive and another is invented, the portfolio feels random. Pick an approach and stick with it.

**Ignoring the parent brand's weight.** A weak parent brand can't endorse sub-brands effectively. Strengthen the parent before proliferating children.

**Skipping availability checks.** Sub-brand names need domain and trademark clearance too, especially if they might become standalone brands later.

## Get the Foundation Right

Strong sub-brand naming starts with a strong parent brand name. If your primary brand name isn't distinctive, memorable, and available, no amount of sub-brand creativity will compensate.
