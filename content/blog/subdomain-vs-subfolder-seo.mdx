## The Debate That Won't Die

Should your blog, store, or help center live on a subdomain (blog.brand.com) or a subfolder (brand.com/blog)? SEOs have debated this for years. Here's what the data actually says.

## Quick Definitions

- **Subfolder (subdirectory):** brand.com/blog, brand.com/store, brand.com/help
- **Subdomain:** blog.brand.com, store.brand.com, help.brand.com

Both are parts of the same domain, but search engines treat them differently.

## What Google Says

Google has given mixed signals over the years. John Mueller has said Google can handle both and that it shouldn't matter much. However, Google also says it sometimes treats subdomains as separate sites for crawling and indexing purposes.

The official answer: "It mostly doesn't matter." The practical answer: it does.

## What the Data Says

Multiple large-scale studies have consistently found:

- **Subfolder content tends to rank better** than equivalent subdomain content
- **Moving from subdomain to subfolder** typically increases organic traffic by 20-50%
- **Domain authority consolidates** in subfolders but fragments across subdomains

Notable case studies:
- **HubSpot** moved their blog from blog.hubspot.com to hubspot.com/blog and saw significant organic growth
- **Moz** recommended subfolders and practiced what they preached
- **Monster.com** moved career advice from a subdomain to a subfolder and saw traffic increase

## Why Subfolders Usually Win

### Authority Consolidation
Every piece of content on brand.com/blog builds the authority of brand.com. The backlinks to your blog posts strengthen your entire domain. With blog.brand.com, those backlinks primarily strengthen the subdomain, with less benefit flowing to the root domain.

### Simpler Architecture
One domain, one sitemap, one Google Search Console property, one analytics setup. Subfolders are easier to manage technically.

### Internal Linking
Links from brand.com/blog to brand.com/product are "internal" links within the same domain — they pass full link equity. Links from blog.brand.com to brand.com are technically "external" links between separate properties.

### Crawl Efficiency
Google allocates a crawl budget per site. With subfolders, your entire site shares one crawl budget efficiently. With subdomains, each one gets its own allocation, potentially causing crawl issues.

## When Subdomains Make Sense

Despite subfolders being the general recommendation, subdomains are better in specific situations:

### Completely Different Applications
If your subdomain runs different technology (e.g., a SaaS app at app.brand.com while the marketing site runs on brand.com), subdomains provide necessary technical isolation.

### International Versions
Subdomains for different countries (de.brand.com, jp.brand.com) can work when paired with proper hreflang tags and geotargeting in Search Console.

### User-Generated Content
If users create content that could be low-quality or spammy, isolating it on a subdomain (community.brand.com) protects your main domain from quality signals.

### Brand Separation
If a sub-brand or product line needs its own identity while remaining connected to the parent, a subdomain provides that balance.

## Migration Guide: Subdomain to Subfolder

If you're currently on a subdomain and want to switch:

1. **Map all existing URLs** on the subdomain
2. **Create matching subfolder URLs** on the main domain
3. **Set up 301 redirects** from every subdomain URL to its subfolder equivalent
4. **Update internal links** across your site
5. **Update Google Search Console** — add the new subfolder content to your main property
6. **Submit updated sitemap** to Google
7. **Monitor traffic** for 4-8 weeks — expect a temporary dip followed by recovery and growth

### Common Migration Mistakes
- Forgetting to redirect all pages (not just the homepage)
- Using 302 (temporary) redirects instead of 301 (permanent)
- Not updating canonical tags
- Removing the old subdomain before redirects are verified

## The Bottom Line

For most businesses, subfolders are the better choice. They consolidate authority, simplify management, and consistently perform better in SEO studies.

Use subdomains only when technical requirements demand it. And regardless of your URL structure, make sure your domain itself is strong — check your brand name's availability across domains, social handles, and trademarks with [BrandScout](/).
