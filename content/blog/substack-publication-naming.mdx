# Substack Publication Naming: Launch a Newsletter Brand That Grows

Substack has become the go-to platform for independent writers, journalists, and thought leaders building direct relationships with their audience. Your publication name is the foundation of your newsletter brand.

## How Substack Naming Works

### Publication Name
Your newsletter's display name. This appears in email subject lines, the Substack app, and recommendations. It should be memorable and communicate your value.

### Subdomain
Your URL is yourname.substack.com. This subdomain is your permanent address on Substack (though you can add a custom domain).

### Custom Domain
Paid Substack plans allow custom domains (newsletter.yourbrand.com), which strengthens your brand and makes you less dependent on Substack's platform.

## Naming Your Publication

### Option 1: Your Name
Many successful Substack writers use their personal name as the publication name. This works when your reputation is the draw:
- "Lenny's Newsletter" (Lenny Rachitsky)
- "The Diff" (Byrne Hobart)
- Personal name builds transferable personal brand

### Option 2: Descriptive Brand Name
A name that describes your content's value proposition:
- "The Hustle" — Business news, energetic tone
- "Stratechery" — Strategy + technology analysis
- "Not Boring" — Makes complex topics interesting

### Option 3: Topic + Format
Combine your subject area with the content format:
- "AI Weekly"
- "Frontend Focus"
- "Climate Tech Report"

## What Makes a Great Newsletter Name

### Clear Value Proposition
Readers should immediately understand what they'll get. "SaaS Metrics Weekly" is clear. "The Lighthouse" is not.

### Memorable and Shareable
Your name needs to work in "Have you read..." conversations. Short, distinctive names spread faster through word of mouth.

### Works in Email
Your publication name appears in email subject lines and sender fields. Test how it looks in an inbox — does it stand out?

### SEO-Friendly
Substack publications rank in Google. A name with relevant keywords helps with organic discovery.

### Grows with You
Avoid names that are too narrow. "React.js Tips" limits you to one framework. "Frontend Weekly" gives room to evolve.

## Substack URL Strategy

### Choose Your Subdomain Carefully
Your Substack URL (yourname.substack.com) should be:
- Your brand name, lowercase, no special characters
- Short and easy to type
- Consistent with your other online handles

### Consider a Custom Domain
Using newsletter.yourbrand.com or yourbrand.com:
- Strengthens brand independence
- Improves SEO with your own domain authority
- Makes you less dependent on Substack if you ever migrate
- Looks more professional

## Growing Your Substack

### Substack Recommendations
When other writers recommend your publication, new subscribers see your name and description. Make both compelling.

### Substack Notes
Substack's social feed (Notes) increases your visibility. Your publication name appears alongside every note you post.

### Cross-Promotion
Exchange recommendations with complementary newsletters. Your publication name is your calling card in these partnerships.

### Guest Posts
Writing guest posts for larger publications exposes your name to new audiences. Make sure your publication name is memorable enough to act on.

## Newsletter Branding Beyond the Name

### Consistent Visual Identity
Logo, header image, and email template should create a recognizable visual brand.

### Writing Voice
Develop a distinctive voice that becomes associated with your publication name.

### Consistent Schedule
Whether daily, weekly, or monthly, a predictable schedule builds reader habits.

## Check Your Publication Name

Before committing to a name, verify it's available as a Substack subdomain and across other platforms.

Use [BrandScout](/) to check your publication name across domains and social platforms. Ensure your newsletter brand is consistently available wherever your readers might look for you.
