## They're Not the Same Thing

One of the most common misconceptions in business: "I registered the domain, so I own the name." This is dangerously wrong. Domain registration and trademark ownership are completely separate legal concepts with different rules, rights, and protections.

## What a Domain Name Is

A domain name is a web address — a string of characters you lease from a registrar to point to your website. Key facts:

- **It's a lease, not ownership.** You pay annual fees to maintain registration. Stop paying, lose the domain.
- **First come, first served.** Whoever registers it first gets it, regardless of trademark status (initially).
- **No inherent legal protection.** Owning example.com doesn't prevent someone from using "Example" as a brand name.
- **Managed by ICANN.** The global domain system is overseen by ICANN and operated by registries and registrars.

## What a Trademark Is

A trademark is a legal protection for a word, phrase, symbol, or design that identifies and distinguishes goods or services. Key facts:

- **It's a legal right.** Trademark registration grants exclusive use in your product/service category.
- **Use-based, not registration-based.** In the US, trademark rights begin when you start using the mark in commerce — registration strengthens those rights.
- **Category-specific.** You can trademark "Apple" for computers, and someone else can trademark "Apple" for music (which is exactly what happened).
- **Managed by government agencies.** USPTO in the US, EUIPO in Europe, WIPO internationally.

## How They Interact

### Scenario 1: You Own the Domain but Not the Trademark
You register coolbrand.com. A company named "CoolBrand" that has been operating for years already owns the trademark. They can:
- File a UDRP complaint to take your domain
- Send a cease-and-desist letter
- Sue you under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA)

**Result:** You could lose the domain.

### Scenario 2: You Own the Trademark but Not the Domain
You've been operating as "CoolBrand" for years with a registered trademark, but someone else owns coolbrand.com. You can:
- File a UDRP complaint if the domain was registered in bad faith
- Negotiate to purchase the domain
- Sue under ACPA if it qualifies as cybersquatting

**Result:** You might get the domain, but it's not guaranteed — especially if the domain holder has legitimate reasons for owning it.

### Scenario 3: Both Are Owned by Different Legitimate Parties
"Delta" is trademarked by both Delta Air Lines and Delta Faucet. Neither is infringing on the other because they operate in different categories. The domain delta.com can only belong to one of them.

**Result:** Domain disputes between legitimate trademark holders are complex and context-dependent.

## What Protects What

| Protection | Domain Name | Trademark |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Prevents others from using your web address | ✅ | ❌ |
| Prevents others from using your brand name | ❌ | ✅ |
| Grants legal rights | ❌ (it's a lease) | ✅ |
| Works internationally | ✅ (domains are global) | Varies (trademarks are jurisdiction-specific) |
| Requires renewal | ✅ (annual) | ✅ (every 10 years) |

## What You Should Do

### Step 1: Check Both Before Choosing a Name
Before committing to any brand name, verify that both the domain AND the trademark are available. A name that fails either check is risky.

### Step 2: Register the Domain First
Domains are first-come-first-served and can be registered in minutes. Secure the domain before someone else does.

### Step 3: File for Trademark Protection
Trademark applications take 8-12 months but provide far stronger legal protection. File as soon as you're using the name in commerce.

### Step 4: Register Social Media Handles
Social media handles sit in a gray area between domains and trademarks. They don't confer legal rights, but losing them to a squatter creates real business problems.

### Step 5: Monitor for Infringement
Use Google Alerts, trademark watch services, and periodic platform searches to catch anyone using your brand name without authorization.

## Check Everything at Once

Don't check domains and trademarks separately. Use [BrandScout](/) to verify your brand name's availability across domains, social handles, and trademark databases in a single search — and avoid the costly confusion between what you've registered and what you actually own.
