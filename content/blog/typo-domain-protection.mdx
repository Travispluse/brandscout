# Typo Domain Protection: Stop Losing Traffic to Misspelled URLs

Every time a customer misspells your URL, they might end up on someone else's site. Typosquatting — the practice of registering misspelled versions of popular domains — is a billion-dollar problem. Here's how to protect your brand.

## What Is Typosquatting?

Typosquatting (also called URL hijacking) is when someone registers a domain that's a common misspelling of an established brand. For example, "gogle.com" instead of "google.com" or "amazn.com" instead of "amazon.com." The goal is usually to capture misdirected traffic for advertising revenue, phishing, or malware distribution.

## Types of Typos to Watch For

### Adjacent Key Typos
When fingers hit the wrong key on the keyboard. "Goole.com" instead of "Google.com" (missing the 'g' because the finger hit the wrong spot).

### Missing Characters
Dropping a letter: "gogle.com" instead of "google.com."

### Extra Characters
Adding a letter: "googgle.com" with an extra 'g.'

### Transposed Characters
Swapping two letters: "gogole.com" instead of "google.com."

### Wrong Extension
Typing .cm instead of .com, or .co instead of .com.

### Homograph Attacks
Using visually similar characters from other alphabets. A Cyrillic "а" looks identical to a Latin "a" but registers as a different domain. This is particularly dangerous for phishing.

## The Real Cost of Typosquatting

- **Lost traffic** — Potential customers who mistype your URL never reach your site
- **Brand damage** — If the typo domain hosts inappropriate content, users associate it with you
- **Phishing risk** — Attackers create convincing login pages on typo domains to steal credentials
- **Advertising loss** — Typosquatters run ads on parked typo domains, potentially for your competitors
- **Legal costs** — Recovering typo domains through UDRP proceedings is expensive and slow

## How to Identify Your Vulnerable Typos

### Analyze Your Brand Name

Look at your domain on a keyboard. Which letters have common adjacent keys? Which letters are commonly doubled or omitted?

### Check Web Analytics

Your server logs and analytics might show referral data from typo domains, indicating which misspellings are actually being used.

### Use Typo Generation Tools

Tools like dnstwist, URLCrazy, and Domain Typo Finder automatically generate likely typosquatting variations. Run your domain through them to see the full landscape.

### Monitor Registration Activity

Services like PhishLabs and DomainTools can alert you when new domains similar to yours are registered.

## Protection Strategy

### Register the Most Common Typos

You can't register every possible misspelling, but focus on the most likely ones. For a domain like "myshop.com," register "myshp.com," "myshoop.com," and "myshopp.com."

### Set Up 301 Redirects

Point all typo domains to your primary site with 301 redirects. This captures lost traffic and prevents others from using those domains.

### Enable DNSSEC

DNS Security Extensions help prevent DNS spoofing attacks that can redirect users to fake versions of your site.

### Use Browser Security Features

Modern browsers have built-in phishing protection. Ensure your site is properly registered with Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft SmartScreen.

### Register Across Similar Extensions

Don't just protect typos in .com. Grab your brand name (and key typos) in .co, .cm, .om, and other easily confused extensions.

## Prioritizing Your Registrations

You can't register every typo. Prioritize based on:

1. **Traffic potential** — How likely is this specific typo?
2. **Risk level** — Could this typo be used for phishing?
3. **Cost** — Some extensions cost more than others
4. **Existing threats** — Is someone already using this typo domain?

## Take the First Step

Understanding which domains are already taken — and which are available for you to register defensively — is the first step in typo protection.

Use [BrandScout](/) to check your brand name across multiple domain extensions instantly. It's the fastest way to see your brand's digital footprint and identify gaps in your protection strategy.
