## It Happens to Everyone

You've found the perfect brand name, the domain is available, and then you check Instagram — @brandname is taken by an account with 3 followers that hasn't posted since 2018. Frustrating, but not a dead end.

Here are your options, ranked from best to most creative.

## Strategy 1: Contact the Current Owner

Many inactive accounts are held by people who've forgotten about them. A polite message can go a long way.

### How to Reach Out
- DM them on the platform (if they accept DMs)
- Check their bio for contact information
- Look up the username on other platforms to find alternative contact methods
- Use a professional, friendly tone: "Hi, I'm starting a business and would love to use this username. Would you be willing to release it?"

### What to Offer
- A small payment ($50-500 depending on the platform and username quality)
- Help them set up a new username if they're still active
- Simply asking — many people release unused names for free

## Strategy 2: File a Trademark Claim

If you own a registered trademark for your brand name, most platforms have trademark dispute processes:

- **Instagram/Facebook:** Intellectual property reporting form
- **Twitter/X:** Trademark policy violation report
- **TikTok:** Intellectual property infringement report

This works best when the account is clearly inactive or squatting. It does not work if the account holder has a legitimate reason to use the name.

## Strategy 3: Request Inactive Account Release

Some platforms release usernames of inactive accounts:

- **Twitter/X:** Has a policy against username squatting and may release names of accounts inactive for extended periods
- **Instagram:** Doesn't officially release inactive accounts, but Meta may clear obviously abandoned accounts periodically
- **TikTok:** May release usernames of accounts that violate terms of service

File reports through each platform's official help center. Be persistent but patient — this can take weeks or months.

## Strategy 4: Use a Consistent Modifier

If you can't get the exact username, add a modifier — but use the *same* modifier on every platform:

### Common Modifiers
- **get**: @getbrandname (suggests action: "go get it")
- **try**: @trybrandname (invites trial)
- **use**: @usebrandname
- **hq**: @brandnamehq (signals "headquarters")
- **app**: @brandnameapp (if you have an app)
- **official**: @brandnameofficial (signals legitimacy, but long)
- **team**: @brandnameteam

### Modifier Rules
- Choose ONE modifier and use it everywhere
- Keep the total username under 15 characters
- Avoid underscores, periods, and numbers if possible
- Make sure the modifier feels natural, not desperate

## Strategy 5: Modify the Brand Name Slightly

Sometimes a small spelling variation works:
- Drop a vowel: @flickr instead of @flicker
- Add a double letter: @hellooo instead of @hello
- Use an abbreviation: @brandnm instead of @brandname

**Warning:** This approach creates confusion. Use it only as a last resort and be consistent across all platforms.

## Strategy 6: Reconsider the Brand Name

This is the nuclear option — but sometimes the right one. If your ideal username is taken on multiple major platforms, it might signal that the name isn't distinctive enough.

A truly unique brand name — especially an invented word — is almost always available everywhere. If you're fighting for usernames across every platform, a more distinctive name might serve you better long-term.

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't add random numbers:** @brandname2847 looks spammy and is impossible to share verbally
- **Don't use different modifications per platform:** @getbrandname on Instagram + @brandnamehq on Twitter = brand confusion
- **Don't impersonate:** Don't create an account that could be confused with the existing holder
- **Don't harass the current owner:** One polite message. If they don't respond, move on to other strategies.

## Prevention Is Better Than Cure

The best strategy is to check social media availability *before* committing to a brand name. Use [BrandScout](/) to verify your brand name across all major platforms, domains, and trademarks in one search — and avoid the username headache entirely.
