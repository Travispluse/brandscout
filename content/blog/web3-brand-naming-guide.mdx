# Web3 Brand Naming Guide: Naming for the Decentralized Internet

Web3 — the ecosystem of blockchain, DeFi, DAOs, and decentralized applications — has developed its own naming conventions and brand culture. Whether you're launching a protocol, DAO, or dApp, your name needs to work within this unique context.

## Web3 Naming Culture

### The Playful Trend
Many successful Web3 brands use playful, irreverent names: Uniswap, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Pudgy Penguins. The culture celebrates creativity and humor over corporate polish.

### The Technical Trend
Protocol and infrastructure projects often use technical or mathematical names: Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche. These signal sophistication and technical ambition.

### The Acronym Trend
DAOs and protocols frequently use acronyms: AAVE, COMP, MKR. These become tokens and are traded under these symbols, making brevity essential.

## Naming Considerations for Web3

### Token Ticker Compatibility
If your project will have a token, your name should produce a clean 3-5 letter ticker symbol. "Uniswap" → UNI, "Chainlink" → LINK, "Aave" → AAVE.

### Smart Contract Naming
Your project name may appear in smart contract code, block explorers, and wallet interfaces. Keep it clean, unambiguous, and free of special characters.

### Multi-Chain Presence
Web3 projects often exist across multiple blockchains. Your name needs to work on Ethereum, Solana, Base, and others without confusion.

### ENS and Blockchain Domains
Register yourproject.eth early. ENS names are crypto-native identity and your community will expect you to have one.

## Naming Different Web3 Entities

### DeFi Protocols
- Names often reference financial concepts with a twist
- "Swap," "Fi," "Yield," and "Pool" are common morphemes
- Keep it pronounceable for podcast discussions and Twitter Spaces

### DAOs
- Community-focused names that feel inclusive
- Often reference the DAO's mission or culture
- "DAO" suffix is optional but common (MakerDAO, PleasrDAO)

### NFT Projects
- Creative, community-driven names
- Animal themes remain popular (Apes, Penguins, Cats)
- The name should work as both a project name and a community identity

### Layer 1/Layer 2 Chains
- Elemental or cosmic themes: Solana, Avalanche, Cosmos, Celestia
- Names that evoke speed, scale, or innovation
- Must be globally recognizable and unambiguous

## Web3 Naming Mistakes

### Trademark Infringement
Web3 isn't a legal gray zone. Trademark holders can and do pursue Web3 projects that infringe on their marks.

### Unpronounceable Names
If nobody can say your project name in a Twitter Space, growth will be slower. The crypto community is highly verbal — podcasts, spaces, and conferences are major channels.

### Confusingly Similar Names
The crypto space has many "swap" protocols and "fi" products. Stand out from the crowd with distinctive naming.

### Culturally Insensitive Names
Web3 is global. Test your name across languages and cultures.

## The Domain Strategy for Web3

Web3 projects typically need:
1. **Traditional domain** (.com, .io, or .xyz) for the main website
2. **ENS domain** (.eth) for crypto-native identity
3. **Social handles** on Twitter/X, Discord, and Telegram
4. **Token ticker** registered on relevant exchanges

## Community-First Naming

In Web3, your community often IS your product. The name should:
- Be something people want to identify with
- Work as a community demonym ("I'm a [Pudgy] Penguin")
- Function in memes and social content
- Create a sense of belonging

## Check Traditional and Web3 Availability

Your Web3 brand needs presence on both traditional platforms and crypto-native ones. Start by checking traditional domain and social media availability.

Use [BrandScout](/) to verify your brand name across domains and social platforms. Secure the traditional web presence, then expand into .eth and blockchain domains.
