## How to Choose

### Ask These Questions

1. **What's your primary goal?** (Sell products → Shopify. Showcase work → Squarespace. Publish content → WordPress.)
2. **How technical are you?** (Not at all → Wix. Somewhat → Squarespace. Very → WordPress/Webflow.)
3. **What's your budget?** (Minimal → WordPress with budget hosting. Moderate → Squarespace or Shopify.)
4. **How much will your site grow?** (A lot → WordPress. Moderately → Any platform.)

### Start Simple

You can always migrate later. Don't let platform analysis paralysis delay your launch. Pick one, build your site, and get your brand online.

## Connecting Your Domain

Every platform above supports custom domains. The process is similar:

1. Register your domain
2. Update DNS records to point to your website builder
3. Configure SSL (usually automatic)
4. Verify the connection

Before building your site, secure the right domain. Use [BrandScout](/) to find an available domain that matches your brand, then connect it to whatever platform you choose.
