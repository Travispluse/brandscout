## What Is a Wildcard DNS Record?

A wildcard DNS record uses an asterisk (*) to match any subdomain that doesn't have its own specific record. If you create a wildcard A record for *.yourbrand.com, then anything.yourbrand.com, test.yourbrand.com, and randomword.yourbrand.com all resolve to the same IP address.

## How Wildcard DNS Works

In DNS, records are matched from most specific to least specific:

1. **Exact match first:** If blog.yourbrand.com has its own A record, DNS uses that
2. **Wildcard fallback:** If no exact match exists, the wildcard record applies
3. **No match:** If there's no wildcard and no exact record, the subdomain doesn't resolve

This means wildcard records act as a catch-all for undefined subdomains.

## Practical Use Cases

### Multi-Tenant SaaS Platforms

SaaS companies often give each customer a subdomain:
- customer1.yourapp.com
- customer2.yourapp.com
- customer3.yourapp.com

A wildcard DNS record lets you add new customers without creating individual DNS records for each one. Your application handles routing based on the subdomain.

### Development and Staging Environments

Developers use wildcard DNS for testing:
- feature-login.dev.yourbrand.com
- bugfix-cart.dev.yourbrand.com

Any developer can create a new subdomain environment without DNS changes.

### Personalized Landing Pages

Marketing campaigns can use dynamic subdomains:
- newyork.yourbrand.com
- chicago.yourbrand.com
- custom-campaign.yourbrand.com

The server serves different content based on the subdomain.

### Catch-All for Typos

If visitors accidentally type wwww.yourbrand.com or ww.yourbrand.com, a wildcard record ensures they still reach your site (combined with server-side redirect logic).

### Multi-Site WordPress

WordPress Multisite can use subdomains for individual sites within a network. A wildcard record enables this without manual DNS entries for each site.

## How to Set Up Wildcard DNS

### Step 1: Access Your DNS Manager

Log into your DNS provider (Cloudflare, your registrar, Route 53, etc.).

### Step 2: Create the Record

Add a new record:
- **Type:** A (or CNAME)
- **Name:** * (just the asterisk)
- **Value:** Your server's IP address (for A) or target domain (for CNAME)
- **TTL:** Your preferred time-to-live

### Step 3: Configure Your Server

Your web server needs to handle requests for any subdomain. In nginx:

```
server {
    server_name *.yourbrand.com;
    # routing logic here
}
```

In Apache, use ServerAlias:
```
ServerAlias *.yourbrand.com
```

### Step 4: SSL for Wildcards

Standard SSL certificates only cover specific domains. For wildcard subdomains, you need a wildcard SSL certificate (*.yourbrand.com). Let's Encrypt supports wildcard certificates through DNS validation.

## Risks and Considerations

### Security Concerns

Wildcard records mean any subdomain resolves to your server. Attackers can use random subdomains for:
- Phishing (fake-login.yourbrand.com)
- Cookie theft across subdomains
- Search engine spam

Mitigate by configuring your server to reject unknown subdomains and by monitoring subdomain usage.

### SEO Impact

Search engines can index random subdomains, creating duplicate content issues. Configure your server to return 404 for unexpected subdomains or redirect them to your main domain.

### Email Implications

A wildcard MX record means email sent to any@anything.yourbrand.com gets delivered. This can invite spam. Only use wildcard MX if you have a specific need and strong spam filtering.

## Wildcard vs. Individual Records

**Use wildcard when:**
- You need dynamic subdomain creation
- You're building a multi-tenant platform
- Managing individual records isn't practical

**Use individual records when:**
- You have a fixed number of subdomains
- You need different subdomains pointing to different servers
- Security is a primary concern

## Your Wildcard DNS Checklist

- [ ] Use case identified and validated
- [ ] Wildcard A or CNAME record created
- [ ] Web server configured to handle wildcard subdomains
- [ ] Wildcard SSL certificate installed
- [ ] Unknown subdomains handled (404 or redirect)
- [ ] Monitoring set up for subdomain abuse
- [ ] SEO implications addressed

Before configuring advanced DNS, make sure you have the right domain. Use [BrandScout](/) to check availability and secure your brand's primary domain.
