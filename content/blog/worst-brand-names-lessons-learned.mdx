## Learning From Failure

Every bad brand name teaches a lesson. These aren't obscure examples — they're names from major companies with big budgets and smart people who still got it wrong. If they can fail at naming, so can you. But you can also learn from their mistakes.

## Naming Disasters and Their Lessons

### Xfinity (Comcast)
**The problem:** Comcast rebranded its cable service to "Xfinity" — a name that sounds like a rejected superhero and tells you nothing about what it is.

**The lesson:** Invented names need to carry some meaning or emotional resonance. "Xfinity" sounds like it was generated by an algorithm that was told to seem innovative. It evokes nothing.

**What to do instead:** If you're rebranding to escape negative associations (as Comcast was), the new name still needs substance. Running from a bad reputation doesn't work if you run toward emptiness.

### Tronc (Tribune Publishing)
**The problem:** Tribune Publishing renamed itself "Tronc" — short for "Tribune online content." It was widely mocked and the company reverted to Tribune Publishing within two years.

**The lesson:** Acronyms and abbreviations need to sound good on their own. Nobody was going to take "Tronc" seriously in journalism. The name sounded like a furniture brand, not a media company.

**What to do instead:** Test your name with real people outside your organization. Internal enthusiasm doesn't predict public reception.

### Qwikster (Netflix)
**The problem:** Netflix tried to spin off its DVD-by-mail service as "Qwikster." The name was announced before Netflix even secured the Twitter handle — which belonged to a user who posted marijuana content.

**The lesson:** Two lessons. First, "creative" misspellings (replacing "ck" with "k," dropping vowels) rarely work. Second, always secure social handles before announcing a name publicly.

**What to do instead:** Check availability across all platforms before your name goes public. And spell words correctly.

### The Shack (RadioShack)
**The problem:** RadioShack attempted to rebrand as "The Shack" to seem more modern. A shack is literally a run-down building.

**The lesson:** Nicknames work when customers create them organically. When the company imposes a nickname, it feels desperate and inauthentic.

**What to do instead:** If customers naturally shorten your name, you can lean into it. But you can't force a nickname from the top down.

### Consignia (UK Royal Mail)
**The problem:** The UK's Royal Mail rebranded to "Consignia" in 2001 at a cost of £2 million. Nobody understood what it meant. It was reversed within 16 months.

**The lesson:** Invented words without intuitive meaning require massive marketing budgets to teach. A 500-year-old institution didn't need a name that sounded like a pharmaceutical company.

**What to do instead:** The more established your brand, the higher the bar for renaming. Don't abandon brand equity for the sake of sounding modern.

### PricewaterhouseCoopers → Monday
**The problem:** PwC named its consulting spin-off "Monday." Yes, named after the day everyone dreads. The name was changed before launch after widespread ridicule.

**The lesson:** Positive associations matter. Even if "Monday" was intended to represent "new beginnings," the overwhelming public association is dread and exhaustion.

**What to do instead:** Test for dominant associations, not intended associations. What do most people think when they hear the name? That's what it means.

### Ayds Diet Candy
**The problem:** A diet product called "Ayds" existed since 1937. When the AIDS epidemic emerged in the 1980s, sales collapsed despite the different spelling.

**The lesson:** External events can destroy a name overnight. You can't predict everything, but you can screen for current negative associations and choose names with fewer vulnerability points.

**What to do instead:** Google your brand name thoroughly. Check news, social media, and cultural context for any existing associations.

## Common Patterns in Bad Names

Looking across these failures, patterns emerge:

1. **Names without meaning** — Invented words that evoke nothing (Xfinity, Consignia, Tronc)
2. **Names with wrong associations** — Words that trigger negative feelings (Monday, The Shack)
3. **Forced cleverness** — Misspellings and abbreviations that feel try-hard (Qwikster)
4. **Ignoring public perception** — Internal teams loving a name that the public hates
5. **Skipping availability checks** — Launching before securing digital presence

## The Prevention Checklist

Before finalizing any name:
- [ ] Does it mean something (or at least feel like something)?
- [ ] Have you tested it with people outside your company?
- [ ] Have you searched for negative associations?
- [ ] Have you checked all social handles and domains?
- [ ] Have you screened for unintended meanings in other languages?
- [ ] Would you be proud to explain this name in a press interview?

## Don't Be a Case Study

The best way to avoid a naming disaster is to validate thoroughly before committing. A few hours of research prevents years of regret.

Use [BrandScout](/) to validate your brand name across domains, social handles, and trademarks — and avoid becoming someone else's cautionary tale.
