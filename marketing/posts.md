## r/webdev

**Title:** I built a free tool to check domain + username availability across 20 platforms

**Body:**

Hey r/webdev 👋

I've been working on [BrandScout](https://brandscout.net) — a free, open-source tool that lets you instantly check if a brand name is available as a domain (7 TLDs) and username across 20 social platforms at once.

**What it does:**
- Checks .com, .net, .org, .io, .co, .dev, .app simultaneously
- Checks username availability on 20 platforms (Twitter, GitHub, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, etc.)
- AI name generator if you're stuck on ideas
- Bulk check — test multiple names at once
- A/B compare — put two names side by side and see which has better availability
- Shareable result cards — send results to your team/client
- Public API if you want to build on top of it
- Installable as a PWA

**Stack:** Next.js, fully open source.

No signup, no ads, no freemium upsell. Just a tool I wished existed when I was naming my own projects.

Would love feedback on the UX or feature ideas. Happy to answer questions about the build.

**Features:**
- AI name generator for brainstorming
- Bulk check (test a whole list at once)
- A/B compare two names side-by-side
- Shareable result cards
- Public API
- PWA — install it on your phone

## r/startups

**Title:** Free tool for checking brand name availability across domains + 20 social platforms

**Body:**

Naming a startup is already hard. Checking if that name is actually available everywhere? That's the tedious part.

I built [BrandScout](https://brandscout.net) to solve this. One search tells you:

- Domain availability across 7 TLDs (.com, .io, .dev, etc.)
- Username availability on 20 social platforms
- Side-by-side comparison of two name options
- AI-powered name suggestions if you're stuck

It's free, no signup required, no ads. Open source.

I've also written 214 blog posts on naming strategy, SEO, and brand identity that might be useful if you're in the naming phase.

Hope it saves someone the 3 hours I used to spend doing this manually.

## r/Entrepreneur

**Title:** Before you buy a domain — check if the name is available everywhere (free tool)

**Body:**

One mistake I see entrepreneurs make (and I've made it myself): you grab a .com domain, start building, then realize the Instagram handle is taken, the Twitter name is gone, and Reddit has it too.

I built a free tool called [BrandScout](https://brandscout.net) that checks domain + username availability across 20 platforms in one search. 

**Why it matters:**
- Consistent branding across platforms builds trust
- Discovering conflicts early saves you from rebranding later
- You can compare two name options side-by-side before committing

Also has an AI name generator if you're still brainstorming, bulk check for testing a whole list, and shareable result cards you can send to partners or co-founders.

No signup, no cost, no ads. Just a useful tool.

## r/SmallBusiness

**Title:** Free tool to check if your business name is available on domains + social media (before you commit)

**Body:**

If you're in the process of naming your business, do yourself a favor and check availability everywhere *before* you fall in love with a name.

I built [BrandScout](https://brandscout.net) — you type in a name and it instantly checks:

- **Domains:** .com, .net, .org, .io, .co, .dev, .app
- **Social media:** 20 platforms including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest, etc.

**Practical features:**
- **Bulk check** — test your whole shortlist at once
- **A/B compare** — put two names side-by-side
- **AI name generator** — get suggestions based on your industry
- **Shareable cards** — send results to your business partner

It's completely free. No account needed, no ads, no hidden fees. I also have 214 blog posts on naming and branding strategy if you want to go deeper.

## r/webdesign

**Title:** Feedback wanted on UX — built a brand name availability checker across 20+ platforms

**Body:**

Hey r/webdesign — I'd love design feedback on [BrandScout](https://brandscout.net).

It's a free tool that checks domain and social media username availability. The challenge was presenting a LOT of data (7 TLDs + 20 platforms) without overwhelming the user.

**Design decisions I'd love feedback on:**
- Result cards — are they scannable enough?
- A/B compare layout — showing two names side by side
- Bulk check results — how to present many names × many platforms
- Shareable result cards — clean enough to send to clients?
- PWA experience — feels native enough?

The tool is open source, free, no signup or ads.

**First Comment (as maker):**

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built BrandScout because every time I started a new project, I'd spend hours opening tabs to manually check if a name was available on every platform.

The goal was simple: one input, full picture. Type a name → see exactly where it's taken and where it's free.

A few things I'm proud of:
- The AI name generator actually gives useful suggestions (not just random word combos)
- A/B compare has saved me from agonizing over two names — just see the data side by side
- It's a PWA so it feels native on mobile

It's 100% free and open source. No monetization plans — just a tool I wished existed.

I'd love your feedback. What platforms should I add? What features are missing?

**Maker Comment (for replies):**

Thanks for checking it out! Built this with Next.js. The whole thing is open source if you want to peek under the hood or contribute. Happy to answer any technical questions.

**Title:** Show HN: BrandScout – Free, open-source domain and username availability checker

**Comment:**

I built BrandScout (https://brandscout.net) to solve a workflow problem: checking if a brand name is available across domains and social platforms meant opening 20+ tabs manually.

BrandScout checks 7 TLDs and 20 social platforms in one search. It also has an AI name generator, bulk check, A/B comparison, shareable result cards, and a public API.

Built with Next.js, deployed as a PWA. Fully open source. No signup, no ads, free to use.

I also wrote 214 blog posts covering naming strategy, domain selection, and branding — partly as a content experiment, partly because I kept learning things worth sharing.

Feedback on the tool or the approach is welcome.

**Title:** I Built a Free Brand Name Checker with Next.js — Here's How

**Tags:** nextjs, opensource, webdev, sideproject

**Cover image suggestion:** Screenshot of BrandScout showing results

---

Every time I started a new project, I hit the same wall: *"Is this name actually available?"*

Not just the domain. The Twitter handle. The Instagram username. GitHub. Reddit. TikTok. YouTube. All of them.

I'd open 20 tabs, type the name into each one, and keep a mental tally. It was painful. So I built [BrandScout](https://brandscout.net).

## What It Does

Type a brand name → instantly see availability across:
- **7 TLDs:** .com, .net, .org, .io, .co, .dev, .app
- **20 social platforms:** Twitter, Instagram, GitHub, TikTok, Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and more

## Key Features

### AI Name Generator
Stuck on ideas? The AI generator suggests brand names based on keywords and industry. Not random gibberish — actually usable suggestions.

### Bulk Check
Have a list of 10 names? Paste them all in and check everything at once.

### A/B Compare
Can't decide between two names? Put them side by side and compare availability across every platform.

### Shareable Result Cards
Working with a co-founder or client? Share a clean result card instead of screenshots.

### Public API
Want to integrate availability checking into your own tool? The API is open and free.

### PWA
Install it on your phone. Works offline for cached results.

## The Tech

Built with **Next.js**. The architecture is straightforward:

- Frontend does the search input and renders results
- API routes handle the actual availability checks
- Each platform has its own checker (some use APIs, some use DNS lookups, some check HTTP responses)
- Results are cached to avoid hammering external services

The whole thing is open source.

## The Content Side

I also wrote **214 blog posts** covering naming strategy, domain selection, SEO implications of brand names, and more. This started as an SEO experiment but turned into genuinely useful content.

## Why Free?

I built this for myself first. Decided to share it because there's no reason to gate-keep a utility tool behind signups and paywalls. No ads, no premium tier, no "sign up to see more results."

## Try It

**Title:** 🚀 BrandScout — Free brand name availability checker (domain + 20 social platforms)

**Body:**

Hey IH! 

**What I built:** [BrandScout](https://brandscout.net) — a tool that checks if a brand name is available as a domain and username across 20 social platforms, all in one search.

**The problem:** Naming a project means manually checking dozens of platforms. It takes forever and you inevitably miss one.

**Features:**
- 7 TLD checks (.com, .io, .dev, etc.)
- 20 social platform checks
- AI name generator
- Bulk check (test a whole list)
- A/B compare (two names side-by-side)
- Shareable result cards
- Public API
- PWA
- 214 blog posts on naming & branding

**Business model:** None. It's free, open source, no ads, no signup. I built it for myself and decided to share it.

**Stack:** Next.js

**What I'd love from this community:**
- Feedback on the tool itself
- Ideas for features or platforms to add
- If you've built something similar, what did you learn?

**Title:** Stop Checking Domain Availability One Tab at a Time

**Subtitle:** I built a free tool that checks brand name availability across domains and 20 social platforms simultaneously

---

You've finally found the perfect name for your project. It's catchy, memorable, and meaningful. You check the .com — it's available! You're pumped.

Then you check Instagram. Taken.
Twitter. Taken.
TikTok. Taken.
GitHub... also taken.

Back to square one.

This is the naming loop from hell, and I've been stuck in it more times than I'd like to admit. So I built a tool to break out of it.

### Introducing BrandScout

[BrandScout](https://brandscout.net) is a free, open-source tool that checks brand name availability across 7 domain extensions and 20 social media platforms in a single search.

No signup. No ads. No "upgrade to see more results." Just type a name and get the full picture.

### Why This Matters More Than You Think

Brand consistency across platforms isn't just nice-to-have — it's a competitive advantage:

- **Discoverability:** When someone searches your brand name, consistent handles mean you own the first page of results
- **Trust:** Matching usernames across platforms signal legitimacy
- **Protection:** Squatters and impersonators thrive on inconsistency

### Features That Actually Help

**AI Name Generator** — When you're stuck, it suggests names based on your keywords and industry. Not random strings — actual brandable names.

**Bulk Check** — Have a shortlist of 10 names? Check them all at once instead of running 10 separate searches.

**A/B Compare** — Can't decide between two options? See them side by side with availability data for every platform.

**Shareable Result Cards** — Working with a team? Share a clean card instead of a spreadsheet or screenshot chain.

**Public API** — Developers can integrate availability checking into their own tools and workflows.

### The Blog

I've also published 214 articles on brandscout.net covering topics like:
- How to choose an SEO-friendly brand name
- The pros and cons of different domain extensions
- Social media handle strategies
- Naming psychology and trends

### It's Free. Really.

No catch. BrandScout is open source. I built it because I needed it, and I made it free because there's no reason not to.
